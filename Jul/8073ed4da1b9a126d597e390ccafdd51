 Head of PR at Ambitiouz Entertainment Gaba Sebego said the singer is happy to form part of the Ambitiouz family and they think she is immensely talented . I can confirm that Cici is part of Ambitiouz she has signed a contract but a formal statement will be issued later in the week. We are happy and she is also exited to be part of Ambitiouz family she said.Although a statement is yet to be released Cici s name has been added to the list of Ambitiouz artists on their social media. A well-placed insider told TshisaLIVE that Cici had independently secured the deal and that Arthur did not know anything about it.When called for comment Cici s alleged ex-lover and now ex boss Arthur told TshisaLIVE that he could not comment on the issue because there are legalities involved. I am sorry I won t be able to comment on any matter relating to Cici as it may form part of the legal processes he said.Cici s departure from Arthur s label 999 comes just weeks after the singer had laid charges of common assault against Arthur.
