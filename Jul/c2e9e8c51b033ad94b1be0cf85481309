 Mmatema told TshisaLIVE that the struggle to stand out ended the minute the Idols tag was merged with her name.She explained that her struggle was now to prove that she is more than an Idols runner up. Life after Idols is all about who can capitalise the most or channel the momentum at the time to prove that they are worthy of being called an artist. I always knew that I was meant to minister through music but I needed a platform to launch me and Idols was it she said.The 25-year-old who recently released a single titled Ke Lerato (it s love) explained that although her upcoming album will offer something for everyone it leans more towards gospel which is her calling .Mmatema entered the reality singing competition in 2015 which Mpumalanga-born Karabo Mogane won. Being on Idols is tough by the time it s done you only have two choices; break or break through. I was sad most times after the show people called me names like Ma Screamer and created memes of me. But I decided to embrace it after Idols if screaming had taken me to top two then screaming was working she said.For now Mmatema plans to work on staying relevant where it matter most...through her music.
