But Old Mutual Investment Group economist Tinyiko Ngwenya expects inflation to average 5.6% in 2017 and for the committee to lower the repurchase rate at least by a cumulative 50 basis points before the end of the year.A little more than three weeks ago R12.75 bought one dollar before the controversy surrounding the Reserve Bank s constitutional mandate rattled the currency.Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane set off the controversy when she ordered Parliament to start a process to review the Bank s mandate from one that protects the value of the rand to one with a socioeconomic focus.The souring investor sentiment towards emerging-market debt has also weighed on the rand.At 4pm the rand was at R13.5618 to the dollar from Monday s R13.486 at R15.4734 to the euro from R15.3712 and at R17.4453 to the pound from R17.3678.The euro was at $1.1410 from $1.1399.
