I told Mduduzi several times that the people who told him he has a child with my daughter lied to him, but he keeps coming to my houseMduduzi, 26, claimed his baby mama, who has never allowed him to see their 6-year-old child since he was born, made the threats after he insisted on seeing the child.The Nothing for Mahala actor, who is a former boxer and currently working as a banker with a major financial institution, said that his baby mama called him last week Friday after his brother was convicted of rape and threatened to open a rape case against him if he insisted on seeing the child.The name of the baby mama cannot be revealed to protect the identity of the child.Police spokeswoman Sonto Mahlangu confirmed Mduduzi visited the Protea Glen police station to register a case against his baby mama, but said they referred him to the family court."The complainant was advised to refer the matter to the family court because it involves the child, so he can apply for visitation rights. We could not register the case about rape threats because it was just allegations."Mduduzi claimed his baby mama tricked another man into raising the child as his own, which explained the resistance against him having a relationship with the child.He said he met the woman when he was living in Norwood, Johannesburg, while working with the late boxing trainer Nick Durandt.Mduduzi said he was 19 and his then girlfriend was 17 and in Grade 11 when they met."She used to come visit me at my flat. After five months of our relationship, the lady called me saying she was pregnant."I told her she must get her family to bring her to meet my aunts to discuss the matter and she said they will come, but they never did," he said.Mduduzi also revealed the woman's mother had accused him of taking drugs and threatened to kill him if he continued to seek seeing his child.Sunday World has seen an SMS sent by the child's grandmother in which she threatened to kill Mduduzi if he continued with his efforts."Ngicela if udakwe insangu or ama drug angakudakeli kithi or kumntwana wami or kumzukulu wami, ngiphinde ngizwe ukuthi uyeweza kithi uzozisola mfana wami ungibheke kahle angibuphuzi utshwala and angibhenya ungibuze abangaziyo and unginike lama number walomuntu othi uyakuphonela"Ama number walomuntu othi uyakuphonela aku update ngomzukulu wami if awufuni ukuphambana ne Zulu qubeka na first time ngezwa ngawe ngathula uyaphinda futhi , wangitshela ubaba kaSmangele ngawe, ngizame futhi uzongithola kahle and ngifuna lama number walomuntu othi owe family yami uyakuphonela b4 lishona ilanga la today"Uze uphinde ulibeke inyawo lakho kithi uzobona isibunu senyoka"Ubatshele kini ukuthi bakuqeqeshe kahle ngathi awufundiswanga"Loosely translated, the grandmother warned Mduduzi he must never set foot at her house after smoking dagga or drugs and demand to see her grandchild.She emphasised that if he continues she will show him what she is made of and he must ask people who know her better to tell him about what she is capable of doing.The woman also demanded that he gives her the name of the family member who called him about the child.The grandmother confirmed sending the SMS to Mduduzi. "I'm now at the police station to obtain a protection order against him because he keeps coming to our house claiming that he has a child with my daughter," she said.She said the child Mduduzi claimed he fathered with her daughter's with another man."I spoke to Mduduzi several times that the people who told him he has a child with my daughter lied to him, but he keeps coming to my house."The granny said Mduduzi started harassing her family in April, and paternity tests were done that proved the child belonged to the man who is currently looking after him."He has also called my grandchild's father harassing him. He is telling him that he wants his child. That boy is crazy," she said.However, Mduduzi's aunt Nompi Radebe begged to differ with the granny about the child's identity.Radebe said the child belonged to Mduduzi and he looks exactly like him."I have seen the pictures of the child and Mduduzi had told us about the baby when the girl was still pregnant."I don't understand why the family does not want us to see him."Radebe said they went to the family's home in Soweto earlier this year to see the child, but were "chased away like dogs" by the baby mama's mother."My questions to her is: was she there when Mduduzi and her daughter made that baby?"Mduduzi's alleged baby mama said she does not have a child with him.She also denied calling him last Friday and threatening him with rape charges."I'm aware that Mduduzi claims there are people who told him that we have a child together, but that's not true," she said.
