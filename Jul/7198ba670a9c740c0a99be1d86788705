 The environment that is affected is the support environment which includes human resources. Computers and hard drives were stolen. Investigators are still checking other offices to check if they were affected Hawks spokesman Brig Hangwani Mulaudzi said.Mulaudzi said case dockets were not stolen as they were kept in a safe place. The information from the human resources offices is highly confidential as it contains members records. We are of the view that we need to dig deep to check what transpired because the area is very secure. You only get inside there with an access card and there was no forced entry Mulaudzi said.The break-in follows several security breaches at state institutions recently including a burglary at the office of the chief justice earlier this year.
