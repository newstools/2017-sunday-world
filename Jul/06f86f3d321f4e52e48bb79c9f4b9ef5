"Crying won't help, my sister. They are gone and life continues"He said thieves jammed his car while he was at a fast food outlet in Woodmead, north of Joburg, and helped themselves to everything inside his car, leaving him bewildered.Masondo, who plays Mangaliso on SABC1's popular youth drama series Skeem Saam, said the tsotsis took his Apple laptop, iPad, cellphones and his music equipment.He said he had his music and beats saved on the devices he lost and had to start from scratch. "Within the 10 minutes we were in there everything was gone and no one saw anything," he said.He said he suspects the security guards were working together with the culprits because they claim they did not see anything but they were there when he and his friend parked the car.He told Sunday World that his request for viewing the security footage was fruitless as he was sent from pillar to post by management of the food store."When we finally got permission to view the footage, they showed us the wrong ones. It was just a tiring process that I decided to let go," he said.He said he just accepted that he lost all his belongings because they were not insured."Crying won't help, my sister. They are gone and life continues," he said.Police spokesman David Mothapo confirmed that a case was opened. "No arrests have been made in that case but we are continuing with investigations," Mothapo said.
