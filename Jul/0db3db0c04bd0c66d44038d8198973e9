 He is accused of assaulting his wife Sylvia in December last year.Dressed in a grey suit, Maponyane stood outside a courtroom in the building's second floor busy on his cellphone.When he finally appeared before magistrate Flora Maila just before 1pm, Maponyane looked calm, despite the whispers in the packed public gallery when his name was called out.The matter was set down for plea and trial yesterday but it was postponed because the docket was locked in the prosecutor's office.Prosecutor Momo Selwadi told the court that the state was ready to proceed but asked that the matter be postponed."The docket is locked in the office. We tried to get a locksmith with no success," Selwadi said
