"According to the current status of his account, the amount has ballooned to R2.5m"Sunday World has learnt that the South African Revenue Service (Sars) obtained a court judgment against the Metro FM presenter in the South Gauteng High Court in November 2015.Court documents seen show that Sars obtained judgment against the talented Idols SA presenter for failing to pay the staggering amount of more than R2.2-million.The amount has allegedly increased to almost R2.5-million after it accrued interests between 2016 and 2017.News of Somizi's hair-raising tax tab was revealed by an accountant who is privy to the A-lister's tax books.Ironically, Madam Gigi's startling tax woes were not included in his much-vaunted "tell-all" book Dominoes: Unbreakable Spirit, which was launched this week amid aplomb and fanfare.Somgaga, who has been flaunting his luxurious items including shoes worth R25000 on his social media pages recently, was not in the mood to discuss his tax matters with Sunday World."Carry on then, I can't talk to you right now. Your timing sucks," he said.Sars spokesman Sandile Memela refused to say much."Sars is bound by the confidentiality clause of section 16 that forbids the organisation to divulge or discuss taxpayers' affairs. This is in line with the Tax Administration Act of 2011," he said.Somgaga recently gloated that he was shopping around for a R6-million house and told millions of his fans that he had bought a BMW i8 worth more that R2-million.The accountant, who did not want to be named for fear of retribution, alleged the taxman started looking into Somizi's finances from 2014 when he flaunted his assets on social media platforms and TV.The former Sarafina choreographer and actor who has a penchant for showing off his wealth, including expensive sets of wheels, was contacted by Sars consultants on numerous occasions, who pleaded with him to make a full disclosure of his income and to submit all his personal tax returns, the source said."After a series of meetings and correspondences with him they went to the South Gauteng High Court where they obtained that judgment against him. But, according to the current status of his account, the amount has ballooned to almost R2.5-million because last year he was in arrears of about R187000. They then imposed interest, that is why the account is where it is now," said the accountant.The accountant also said Somizi stands to lose his assets, which include his Soweto home, if he does not settle his exorbitant bill."Before they attach his property they do what we call auditing. That means they would order his bank to give them his statements for the past five years."If they find that there is no correlation between what he has submitted and his income then they will attach and auction off his assets to recoup what's due to them," said the accountant.
