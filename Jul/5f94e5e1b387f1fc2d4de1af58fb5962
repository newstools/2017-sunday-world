 The popular actor, who plays Emkay in the youth drama, and his friends were left shaken when a group of about four armed robbers pounced on them outside a friend's home on Sunday night on the East Rand.The KwaZulu-Natal-born actor - who earlier this year released his first maskandi song under new stage name Skandi Kid - said the incident only took less than a minute."Just when I was about to start the car these guys appeared from nowhere and ordered us to lie down. They searched us and took our phones, wallets and some of our belongings. There were about four or five of them in two cars," he said."It has not sunk in yet for me. I don't even know how I feel, all I know is that the car is gone."Police spokesman Captain Mega Ndobe said a case of hijacking was opened in Katlehong.
