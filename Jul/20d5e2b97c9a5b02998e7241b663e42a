 The SABC announced on Friday that it would pull the soapie's omnibus for this week's episodes which were scheduled to air yesterday."This is due to the viewer complaints the channel has received about the alleged explicit content shown during this week's episodes of the popular soapie."The channel will replace this week's episodes by airing the first five episodes of Generations: The Legacy that first went to air on December 1-5 2014."We would like to assure our viewers that we take their feedback seriously and would like to apologise for any inconvenience or discomfort this week's episodes may have caused," reads a statement issued by SABC1.The statement followed feedback from viewers on social media that this week's episodes were promoting pornography on public TV.Sunday World understands that the complaints were informed by the characters Smanga Moroka, played by Moopi Mothibeli, and Tshidi, played by Letoya Makhene, as well as the soapie's latest character Thabi, played by Motsoaledi Setumo.The soapie has featured a number of explicit scenes for the past two weeks involving the trio's relationships, ranging from their excessive smooching, bikini wears, tying of hands using a scarf during an intimate moment, whips and wearing of skimpy dresses.In one of the scenes played on Thursday evening, that appears to have irked the viewers, Motsoaledi was shown on the screens flashing her bum in a bikini after she went to Smanga's house to surprise him.She was also shown pulling out a whip during their kissing session, asking Smanga to whip her to maximise his sexual satisfaction.In the same episode, Motsoaledi asked Smanga to tie her hands with a scarf. The scene actually depicted a scene similar to the one from the raunchy Fifty Shades Of Grey.Even before Thursday's episode, the soapie had been running a raunchy storyline involving Makhene's character, Tshidi, who has been having a relationship with Smanga.In one of the scenes, Makhene was shown wearing sexy lingerie, including a G-string and sometimes a skimpy dress like a nurse who was sent to pleasure Smanga.Other episodes that might have also raised the viewers' temperature include an episode which was played two months ago in which the character of Namhla Diale, played by Thulisile Phongolo, was shown striping to just a bra and panty trying to break into a tunnel leading to a Russian gangster's office.Another episode relates to a scene where Motsoaledi was shown flaunting her body during a bikini shoot.The two episodes trended on Twitter. Some viewers embraced them, while others claimed the producers took it a tad too far.
