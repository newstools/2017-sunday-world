 The Kaizer Chiefs striker is slowly finding his footing in the country and doesn't hesitate when asked if his stay has been enjoyable thus far."The country has been good to me. It's a paradise," Paez said.He may feel that way because his home country, Venezuela, is in such political turmoil that he has not returned since signing for Chiefs at the beginning of the year."The last time I was there was in December. It's bad. There's no food. Hospitals don't have medicine. Even now, during off-season, I decided to visit my sister in America, rather than go home."With all this in mind, Paez is hoping to make a big impact in his first full season with Chiefs so as to see out or extend his two-year deal and not be forced to return home amid the chaos."I have found a home here and I want to make sure that I work even harder to complete my contract, or get even more years. Last season, I joined in the middle and scored five goals. This time my target is 10 or more goals."The 27-year-old showed promise for the new season as he bagged a brace in Chiefs' friendly last weekend.He conceded he had a lot of adjustments to make after arriving at Naturena in January."I had to learn the culture of the club, get used to new teammates, their style," he said.There was also a language barrier, but his English has improved tremendously as he conversed with the media and fans without assistance at the club's kit promotion in Sandton this week."I'm picking up the language daily as I speak to people in the club. Only [goalkeeper coach] Alex [Revoredo] and [fitness trainer] Marco [Munhoz] speak Portuguese and Spanish. So I don't have much of a choice. But it's becoming easier," Paez said.He said he hopes his goals will help Chiefs win a trophy or two in the new term, although he seems to have scored off the pitch already."My wife is here with me and she's pregnant. We will welcome our baby in December."
