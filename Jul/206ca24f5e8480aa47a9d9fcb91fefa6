 KwaZulu-Natal-based outfit Maritzburg United this week appointed Fadlu Davids to the helm on a two-year deal after Davids took over in the middle of last season.He will be assisted by his brother Mahier Davids while former Kaizer Chiefs shot-stopper Arthur Bartman remains the goalkeeper coach.But for years Davids worked with former Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp at Maritzburg as well as at Bloemfontein Celtic and Chippa United.With no assistant coach experience, Cape Town City broke the chain early this month by bringing in Bafana Bafana all-time leading goal-scorer Benni McCarthy onto the coaching hot seat.McCarthy, the only SA player to win the Uefa Champions League (with Portuguese side FC Port in 2004), scored 31 goals for the national team.Former Bafana skipper Aaron "Mbazo" Mokoena has backed the former Orlando Pirates striker's appointment to succeed Eric Tinkler at the Mother City outfit.Mokoena urged teams to give former players a chance as head coaches. "McCarthy will do a brilliant job at City. He is my boy and I have faith in him."As a player, he proved that he was talented and I do not see him failing as a coach, especially because he has the right qualifications and has played at the highest level," said Mokoena, who promised to announce his next career move soon."Former players must be considered when local clubs look for coaches. In this country it is very difficult to become a coach after retiring because our teams believe in foreign coaches and in experienced ones. You only get experience by being given a chance first."Some would argue that it is precarious for teams to throw former footballers into the deep end, especially those who do not have experience of coaching at the highest level.The trend continues as some former players who have served as assistant coaches find it hard to secure head coach jobs in top-flight football.Davids and McCarthy follow in the footsteps of Tinkler who coached Pirates and Cape Town City and is now at SuperSport United.Again, what clouds Tinkler and Davids' appointments is that they started out as assistant coaches.
