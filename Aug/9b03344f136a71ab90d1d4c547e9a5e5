 One of the core amendments proposed is that, from March 1 2019, all SA individual tax residents will be subject to SA income tax on foreign employment income earned outside SA.Currently, SA tax residents outside SA for their employer for a period exceeding 183 days (60 days of which must be continuous) during any period of 12 months, enjoy an exemption from SA income tax on their foreign employment income.However, National Treasury is of the view that this creates opportunities for double non-taxation in cases where the foreign host country does not tax the individual, or it taxes at a significantly reduced rate.An additional reason given is that government employees who work outside SA do not qualify for the exemption.In the budget earlier this year, it was indicated that foreign employment income would only be exempt from tax if the income was subject to tax in the foreign country.However, Treasury has proposed to remove the exemption completely. -Brown is associate director specialising in international tax at Webber Wentzel
