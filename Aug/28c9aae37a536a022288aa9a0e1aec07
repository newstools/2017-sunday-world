 The population growth rate is well above the economy's growth rate and at the same time our matric pass rate suggests that almost 50% of children starting school don't write or pass matric. This results in a large, under-skilled labour force.Over the past year the unemployment rate increased by 1.1% to 27.7%.Over the second quarter of 2017 we witnessed a 113000 net decline in employment, with the largest losses recorded in construction (110000) and agriculture (40000). This is a reflection of an economy under pressure.What South Africa needs given our current skill base is job creation in the growth engines of the country, such as mining, manufacturing and agriculture.Unfortunately the future remains bleak as mines and retailers shed jobs. - Citadel
