 After singing a worship song in his honour Simz poured her heart out about the love they shared. One of Dumi s talents was loving me effortlessly and so truly. I always say that not a lot of people get to experience what I experienced people long for that love she said.Simphiwe said that she knew it was unusual for a wife to speak at her husband s funeral. WATCH: Simphiwe Ngema dressed in white for Dumi's funeral I know it is not a norm for a wife to stand up and speak at her husband s funeral but hey guess what neither is losing your husband two months after your marriage she said.Simphiwe said that Dumi told her he was so sorry at the hospital. He didn t look like he was going to pass on he looked so strong. I told him you re the one who is hurting and you are saying sorry to me. She said that Dumi had amazing strength that he got from God and his mother. I feel like he has given me all his strength she said. DumiMasilelafuneral https://t.co/Rh3WVVqySb
