 Sunday World can exclusively reveal that the 14 sports presenters and analysts signed the contracts extension last Friday during a meeting called by SABC management.It is believed that the decision was made by the board as they believed the matter was not handled fairly by management. The group earlier made a submission to the board complaining about the way the decision not to renew their contracts was handled.The group includes soccer legend Marks Maponyane, Cudjoe Amankwa, Christopher Bongo, Lindani Mbense, David Kekana, Sylvester Ndaba, Kwena Moabelo, coach Mike Mangena, Papi Khomane, Rabbie Moripe, Gloria Brown and Fabian McCarthy.Among some of their complaints, according to the group's convener, Kekana, was the fact that they were not given notice. They also argue that the explanation given by the SABC that it had no money was insufficient to warrant their dismissal. In their submission, the group had also alleged that they were being purged because they didn't get along with management.However, the battle is far from over as the group would have to renegotiate their contracts when the two-month period expires.The matter is currently being handled by the board in consultation with management. The board is expected to either endorse management's decision to lay them off or bring them back with long-term contracts."We will keep on having discussions with the board until the matter is fully resolved," Kekana said.SABC spokesperson, Kaizer Kganyago, confirmed that the presenters and analysts had been given two months' contract extensions by the public broadcaster."As a matter of courtesy, the board has decided that the group be given two months contract extensions from July until end of August."The decision is not mandatory and cannot be used as a precedent as it is not in their contracts that the SABC must give them notice."Therefore the SABC's earlier decision not to renew the contracts still stand," said Kganyago.
