 And with only three weeks remaining, finalists are gearing up to pitch their businesses to a judging panel in Hyde Park, Johannesburg, on August 16.Launched on June 8, entrepreneurs from Jo burg and Cape Town were invited to pitch "a tech idea that will disrupt the African continent".After a rigorous selection process, both on-and offline, the eight "tech heroes" were cherry-picked for their promising business acumen, resilient entrepreneurial spirit and savvy technical insight.The "tech heroes" are Ntando Shabalala from Graft House - a tinder for job seekers; Patrick Machekera from Ispani - a brand activation agency focusing on township communities; Aubrey Nyaguse from Skills Gorilla - a talent match-making platform; Alex Gabriels and Jade Venter from Spritzed - an Airbnb for office space; Anthony Bruce from Flippen Clever - a textbook rental service for students; Tannon Balanco from Bazinga Services - an on-demand transportation services; and Thomas Hart from Rover - a personalised travel platform.The purpose of the programme is for start-ups to take their wild ideas to a validated business model, create a prototype and get their first customers on board, which usually takes about a year but must be done in a space of just 12 weeks, without spending any money.Machekera says: "The mentors are definitively a highlight for me. All of them are brilliant and nonconventional. I had originally thought that it would just be a quick meet and greet because they are such busy and successful entrepreneurs."But they truly took an interest in me ., making an effort to fully understand my business and, ultimately, connect me to the right people to roll out my business on a large scale."1Giantleap is a start-up incubator in Joburg and Cape Town
