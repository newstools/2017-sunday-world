 This was revealed at a media conference on Thursday at AfriForum s offices in Centurion at which the alleged victim Gabriella Engels and her mother Debbie were present. There wasn t an amount offered to them (the Engels family). The indication was: come up with a figure AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel said.Caty van der Merwe from AfriForum s Trauma Unit said there was no direct threat if Engels did not accept the offer. She is living in fear actually to go out into the public now. The family is living in fear for what might happen. Debbie Engels thanked AfriForum for their help. At least now I can sleep a little more peaceful knowing I have people in my corner that is gonna help me fight to get justice for my daughter. AfriForum approached 20-year-old Gabriella after she was allegedly assaulted by Mugabe on Sunday night with an electrical extension cord at a luxury hotel in Sandton Johannesburg where her two sons were thought to be staying.Gabriella on Monday opened a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm at the Sandton police station and Mugabe was widely thought to be appearing in court on Tuesday. But by the close of business on that day she hadn t been arrested or handed herself over to the police.AfriForum will offer Gabriella legal support and counselling.
