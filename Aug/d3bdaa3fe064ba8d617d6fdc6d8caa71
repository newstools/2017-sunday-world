 This comes after the church's self-proclaimed new leader, Tshepiso Modise, instructed his lawyer Emmanuel Lekgau to warn members against buying CDs compiled by Thabo Sekgonyane, a former contractor to the church.Lekgau communicated the message to all members and said Modise is the only legitimate person mandated by the church to deal with its music affairs.The lawyer, who was also part of Modise's legal team during a high court case over control of the church and its bank accounts, also lambasted Sekgonyane using the church's uniform on his CD sleeves.He accused Sekgonyane of stealing the church's intellectual property and labelled the CD as "fake music" produced by a "fraudster"."The church intends to lay a charge of fraud and theft against the member because what he is doing is wrong. It's pure theft," said Lekgau. He also accused Sekgonyane of being the mastermind behind attempts to wrest control of the church from the Modise family."This man had a music shop at the church and was also renting his music instruments to the church. However, when the comforter [the late Bishop Glayton Modise] passed away in February last year, his relationship with the church was discontinued," Lekgau said.Comforter is the term IPHC members use for the the church's leader.Lekgau said the music producer appears to have decided to defy church instructions that he stop making and selling music using the church's name and brand.Sekgonyane dismissed Modise and his lawyer: "How is my musical talent a property of the church? I was blessed by God."Those two don't know what they are talking about."He said the CD in question was his fourth studio album, and that the three earlier albums were endorsed by the late bishop."I had even registered the church as a beneficiary of the royalties which had since been paid out."Although Sekgonyane disputed he was behind the #ModiseMustFall campaign, he confirmed he was against Tshepiso."He is a self-appointed comforter who imposed himself on a position he does not deserve. I'm not against him as a person, but his actions."He said the letter circulated to church members was fake."I asked the comforter about the letter before he died and he told me he knew nothing about it. He never signed such a letter ."He said the contract signed with the late leader of the 3.5million strong church was still in place. "What I know is that when the comforter gives you a job, nobody can take it. The only person who can terminate the contract is him, and he has passed away."
