 Fast forward three years, and Maluleke is the proud owner of four companies - one of which he hopes will see him break new ground in chicken farming."After I realised my potential I took a step forward and ventured into business and since then I have never looked back," said Maluleke."I became a businessman out of passion. I also wanted to fulfil my childhood dream of being a business mogul (that rose) from the streets."Maluleke recalled his childhood days when his father, who was allegedly abusive towards his mother, kicked him out."He hit me and kicked me out and I ended up on the streets, sleeping under the bridge at Chiawelo Station [in Soweto]," said Maluleke.Today he is the owner of Vanwanati Business Investments, which focuses on business development coaching and funding structures; LE Lapa Constructions, which deals with building houses, pavements and tiling; and LE Lapa Estate and Property, which buys, sells and manages properties.Maluleke currently employs six permanent employees and several temporary workers.As if his hands are not full enough, his next challenge is to make inroads in the chicken farming sector."The chicken farm is new and I'm working on paperwork to ensure that I comply. It is something I am interested in and I look forward to growing in chicken farming."We will soon will be launching a brand of chicken braai packs locally," said the businessman.Maluleke holds a diploma in media and journalism and an entrepreneurship certificate from Sir Richard Branson's Centre of Entrepreneurship.Maluleke won two awards as a journalist and a few others in business, as a wealth speaker and business coach."I am always booked so I don't have spare time. My friends understand and support my hectic schedule and respect my legacy that I'm creating," said the father of two.Among challenges he faced to establish his businesses was the lack of support for entrepreneurs from townships."The red tape of government agencies towards small business owners and their compliance regulations needs to be looked at as that affects many potential businesses in the country," he added.Maluleke said his mother Joyce Maluleke was his greatest inspiration.
