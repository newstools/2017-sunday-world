 Carelse, who replaced Robert Marawa as sports presenter on Metro FM, said his Fontainebleau, Randburg, neighbourhood has been targeted by burglars despite residents resorting to private security companies for protection.In the latest hit, Carelse, who is TV and radio personality Andile Gaelesewe's ex-husband, lost a television set and camera while he was attending a funeral in Cape Town in May."They broke a window and waited for the alarm to go off before they went into the house. They took a TV and camera and ran away when the guy who stays in the cottage reacted to the alarm," he said.He said the second incident happened last year during the Easter weekend."The alarm had stopped functioning on a Thursday and when I called the armed response company, they told me they would fix it after the long weekend."During that weekend I was away and they broke in, taking computers and hard drives I use for work," he said.Carelse said the first burglary happened in 2015, three years after he had moved to the suburb in Joburg's north.The burglars broke in a day before his scheduled meeting with an armed response company. "They stole two mountain bikes and other items."Carelse said after the series of burglaries, he does not trust the armed response companies. "I have established a WhatsApp group for community members where we alert each other when there is something suspicious," he said.He said he "never" considered moving because he loves the area and likes the freedom that comes with a free-standing house.All the burglary cases were reported at the Linden police station, Carelse said.Police spokesman Walter Spencer confirmed the cases were opened but no arrests had been made in any instance.
