Club 808 presenter and choreographer Bontle Modiselle showed off her sexy dance moves recently. While flaunting her curves in a rainbow bikini wrap-dress, Modiselle had a fun dance-off on the “Oh Ship” cruise. She dropped it like it’s hot to Distruction Boyz’s hit song Omunye. Modiselle was also shooting for the etv music show with her co-star Lawrence Maleka.
