Those people at the National Energy Regulator of SA (Nersa) are charmzas for giving  consumers a reprieve from Eskom.  The state-owned power utility had applied for a 20% hike in electricity prices, but Nersa granted the corruption-riddled parastatal only 5.2%.  Thank you for little mercies. It's definitely better than what those wasteful Eskom moegoes wanted.
