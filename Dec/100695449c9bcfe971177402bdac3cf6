The boxing fraternity and, to a larger extent, the man on the street are too quick to rubbish promoters when they fail to stage a boxing tournament. It appears simple and easy when looking from outside but get involved in the whole exercise, then one will find out how daunting a task it is to actually organise a tournament. That is why some of us salute every single promoter when they deliver. Granted, boxers suffer when a tournament is called off because of the sacrifices they make once they sign contracts to fight. Some even go as far as to borrow money so they get supplements and a better diet, and it becomes a problem when a tournament does not go ahead as planned. In that situation the contracts says if a tournament is cancelled or postponed boxers are due 10% of their agreed purse monies. The first step is to sign contracts and pay purse monies for boxers to Boxing SA within 14 days. A promoter must also pay for local officials with BSA. A promoter must then follow all compliance regarding security, police, hospital, ambulance, suitable venue and doctors, paid for by the promoter. Once that is done they can start marketing their tournaments. Boxing SA helps promote the tournament via social media. Simply put, a promoter must do everything from their pockets before they get any money from sponsors which only pays after the event. We now know what promoters go through before we gather at a venue to witness the action.
