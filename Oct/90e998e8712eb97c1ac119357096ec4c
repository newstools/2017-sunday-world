The International Pentecost Holiness Church (IPHC) has obtained a court order at the Limpopo High Court to stop members aligned to late Bishop Glayton Modise's second- born son Leonard from assaulting their rivals and disrupting church services in their Limpopo branches. They have also interdicted Phatane Tribal Authority, Baroka Maloga Ditshelo and Chief Tobane April Masha from shutting down the church building in which services are held in Tubatse area, Limpopo. Chief Masha was instructed to appear in court on October 30 to explain why the order should not be made permanent. The interdict was applied by advocate Papi Maluleke on behalf of the executive committee of the church's headquarters in Silo, south of Joburg, after receiving complaints that members who want Leonard to ascend to the throne allegedly disrupted services and assaulted those who don't recognise him or his eldest brother Tshepiso as the legitimate heir to the throne. It is also alleged the members, who call themselves BGB (Bring God Back), were urged on by Masha, who shut down the church building in solidarity with the group's demands.
