My brother. Great Album. You spoke from the streets to the heavens. Joy pain wins loses. I dig it he said.Cassper dropped Thuto which is named after his older sister on May 5 and so far fans have been loving it. Speaking at the launch of his album Cassper said Thuto lets fans in on his life.Cassper said that he felt it was time to let his fans in on his life because he has produced a lot of hits and is no longer after the sales. It s a very personal album and I felt it was time for me to start making music like that because I ve proved my point I ve made so many hits and I didn t expect people to react like that he said at the time.
