 The former Soccer Zone and Soccer 411 presenter was given his marching orders by SABC general manager for sports Keletso Totlhanyo last Monday.In the letter, Totlhanyo told Moabelo that his services were no longer needed effective from May 1 - Workers Day.Sunday World has learnt that Totlhanyo was allegedly acting on the instruction of her boss - SABC group executive for sports Sully Motsweni.Moabelo confirmed that he had been barred from presenting soccer on the public broadcaster. "The decision is not yet final because I have requested a meeting with the SABC on the matter. As such, I won't comment further," said Moabelo, a lawyer by training.SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said: "The SABC will not discuss the contracts of employees with the media. All employees have a direct communication line with the employer, the SABC ..."Apparently, Moabelo was told in the letter that he was doing too many shows because he was presenting current affairs, boxing and soccer.An SABC staffer said the decision to curtail Moabelo was informed by his decision to take a gig at Power FM."That argument does not hold water, though. There are other sports presenters who are working for other broadcasters but they singled him out. It's clear that the decisions are informed by other things outside work. The SABC recently hired a reporter who is also working for Talk Radio 702," said the staffer.Moabelo joined SABC Sports in 2008 as host of daily sports show Game Plan on SAfm after leaving Kaya FM, where he rose through the ranks to become the station's sports manager.
