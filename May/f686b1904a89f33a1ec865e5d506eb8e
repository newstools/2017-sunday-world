 Pirates and SuperSport United are the only two sides to have always finished in the top eight in the PSL era.But the Buccaneers are struggling in 10th spot ahead of their clash against Phunya Sele Sele. This is a difficult assignment for Pirates, because their record in Bloemfontein is nothing to write home about.You have to go back to the 2007/08 season for the last time Bucs beat Celtic away. Defender Happy Jele is the only remaining Bucs player who played in that match a decade ago, and is expected to feature again tonight.Others who remain active today who featured in that match are Teko Modise (Mamelodi Sundowns), Tlou Segolela (Polokwane City) and Paulus Masehe (Free State Stars).Most like Innocent Mdledle, Excellent Walaza and Lucas Thwala are not even playing the game anymore. Since then, Celtic have dominated Pirates on their own turf with four victories and four draws over the past eight seasons.The two sides have also met twice in the cup at Celtic's home ground, with the hosts winning on both occasions. Celtic beat Pirates 2-1 in the last 16 of the Nedbank Cup in 2009 and 5-3 on penalties in the quarterfinals of the 2012 Telkom Knockout.So Pirates will have to dig deep for a result in the Free State and ensure a top eight finish by the end of the season. "This is a very important game for us," commented Bucs coach Kjell Jonevret.Meanwhile, Celtic coach Lehlohonolo Seema expects nothing but a win against his former team."Losing is not an option as that might result in panic (in their relegation fight)," Seema told the club's website.
