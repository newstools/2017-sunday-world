 At the same time, the information age has ushered in immediate accessibility of everything. Instant gratification is the new normal for some.So it comes as no surprise that snacks made from natural ingredients, with added vitamins but no added sugars or preservatives, are becoming increasingly popular.Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, known as the father of modern medicine, said, "Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food", and this philosophy has once again become important in our path to a healthier life."We're seeing more and more how consumers are leaning on their diets, and not on pharmaceuticals, to prevent disease and optimise their health," says Bruce Dennison, president of the Health Products Association of South Africa (HPASA).Along with this increasing reliance on health products comes a greater thirst for knowledge about them.So-called "hyper-functional" foods, which combine health-giving natural ingredients with added vitamins and proteins, are gaining in popularity as are natural and herbal tonics.Vital Health Foods nutritional expert Andrea du Plessis says: "Hyper-functional foods are playing an increasingly crucial role in our daily lives as we no longer have the time to have three balanced meals a day, and rely on snacking for much of our nutritional intake."He says many retailers are seeing the shift in how consumers are relying on snacking even more and are creating hyper-functional foods in the form of health bars, raw food bars and energy bars to meet the demand.
