 Stars lost 1-0 to Cape Town City on Friday night in a game in which they created half-chances only but were competitive through the 90 minutes.The result leaves Stars outside of the relegation playoff position on goal-difference only and just a single point above automatic relegation having played a game more than Baroka FC and Highlands Park below them.But Letsoaka says there will be no problem with morale in the camp and that they will keep on fighting. The morale of the boys is unbelievable they know it is not over he said. Even after conceding [against City] you could see the morale of the boys remained high. They know there will be setbacks but they have to pick themselves up and not look to what has happened but what could still happen. I have no doubt about the level of mental strength from our boys. Going into the game against Wits we are not going to look down we will go there and try and fight with everything we have. Stars do have an excellent home record against Wits who have won just two of their previous 13 trips to face Ea Lla Koto. If the Gods of football are still with us this is one of the games we will definitely win because they have not had a good record against us at Goble Park Letsoaka says. We are hoping that the same record we have had over the years will repeat itself. We need to make sure our hopes are raised by the performance we put in on the day. Aside from Wits Stars must still make the short journey to provincial rivals Bloemfontein Celtic and then host Chippa United on the final day of the season. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
