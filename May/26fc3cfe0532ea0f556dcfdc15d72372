 This is exactly the situation Kaizer Chiefs defender Ramahlwe Mphahlele finds himself in. On a personal level, the 27-year-old will look back with satisfaction at his contribution in his first season at Naturena.However, as a team, it has been another disappointing season for the club as they haven't won anything."Unfortunately it's not boxing where you play for yourself. It's a team and our team works very hard," Mphahlele told Sowetan."The most important thing is we should compete as a team and that's what matters to me when we go onto the pitch."As much as his first season as a "Glamour Boy" has gone well, the former Mamelodi Sundowns captain is disheartened by the fact that Chiefs are yet to win a trophy.Mphahlele, who was man of the match in their 2-2 draw against SuperSport United last weekend, admitted that Chiefs have at times been their own worst enemies, especially in the race for the league title."It could have been a much better season had we focused and not lost points at the crucial stage of the season."I really believe we had a big chance of winning the league," he said."Look, we are still there and it's not actually up to us. It will be very difficult now, because everybody is alert and focused. We have to pray for miracles."Be that as it may, the Limpopo-born defender says even though Chiefs may be struggling to win trophies now but the future looks brighter."I think our team has played good football, but the end result sometimes let us down."
