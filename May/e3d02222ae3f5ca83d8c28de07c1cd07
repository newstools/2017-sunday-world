 Moloi, who is also Rebecca Malope's backing singer, said he watched his mother being emotionally and physically abused by her boyfriend.The incident took place over 10 years ago, and it still haunts him, he said.He said on the day, about 10 years ago, when he returned from a meeting, he found his mother hacked with an axe."When I got home, people were standing outside our shack. My mother was lying there with a gaping wound in her head. She was rushed to hospital. She stayed there for days. When she was released, I took her home to Villiers [in Free State] and she died four days later."Moloi revealed that he never really dealt with the incident, and as a result he becomes too emotional whenever he comes across an abusive situation.
