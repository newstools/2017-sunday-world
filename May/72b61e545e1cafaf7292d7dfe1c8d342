 Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba recently surprised his wife with a new piece of jewellery.Why? Probably because he just felt like spoiling his lady.Norma shared a picture gushing over the new ring but later deleted the picture. So in love with this new piece...thank you my hubby Norma captioned the snap.
