 His second goal in as many Absa Premiership matches inspired the defending league champions to a 2-0 victory over an Orlando Pirates side that has now conceded eight goals in two league matches against the Brazilians this season.It was not as humiliating for the Buccaneers as it was when they were clobbered 6-0 at Loftus in February, but they still hardly made Sundowns sweat.Sundowns enjoyed more possession and easily found spaces in the Pirates defence during the first half, with Khama Billiat, Themba Zwane, Percy Tau and Zakri giving the hosts' defence a lot to think about.Sundowns broke the deadlock through a man who has not been at his best recently. Billiat's header, from a deflected cross, beat Jackson Mabokgwane in the Pirates goal in the 25th minute.While the PSL drags its feet on a case that should have been dealt with months ago, some Pirates fans behind Denis Onyango's goal threw objects onto the pitch.To this day, no penalty has been handed out to Pirates for the behaviour of their supporters at Loftus in February, when they vandalised the stadium and invaded the pitch.How are supporters supposed to learn their lesson if action is not taken swiftly?After Sundowns scored the second goal through Zakri three minutes into the second half, police officials became more visible to make sure the home fans did not get out of order.Late in the game, Billiat struck the crossbar in a brilliant move that should have ended with a goal.
