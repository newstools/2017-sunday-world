The angle that it came with it made me stronger. If I had caught Malusi doing something then I wouldn t even be here today. But everything was delivered to me. I am an analyst so I want to know what your intentions are of you telling me this. So what do you want me to do especially since my marriage is so new. Buhle who often shares pictures of her glam life travelling around the world on social media has previously taken shots at Malusi and Norma threatening to reveal messages recordings and other damning info about the Gigabas.A Twitter account set up on Tuesday reportedly by Buhle explained that her family has asked her not to get any more involved in the saga. But the account said her family is only on Instagram and not Twitter.Buhle has previously said she is only on Instagram and plans to run a blog detailing her health and fitness routine.The validity of the account could not be proven at the time of publishing this article but the tweets did threaten to expose Norma and Malusi.
