 The budding actress is the daughter of openly-gay TV star Somizi Mhlongo and TV personality Palesa Madisakwane. She is the granddaughter of veteran actors Mary Twala and the late Ndaba Mhlongo."I grew up in a family that was always in the spotlight, everywhere I was with my mom or dad there were cameras around or fans wanting to catch a glimpse of us or wanting to say 'hello'," says Madisakwane."I was raised mainly by my mom, but both my parents were there for me. I understood when they told me the focus isn't on me. They wanted me to go to school and get an education."Now that Madisakwane is a "big girl", at 22, her parents have released the leash, freeing her to explore what she wants to do career-wise.Last year, she received a car from her father as a gift for her 21st birthday. Her mother, who is her spitting image, is a renowned actress in her own right after playing a prominent role as herself, Palesa, on SABC1's Generations and hosting a number of gospel music shows."I'm not following in their footsteps as many would want to believe, but I can't deny that they were influential."Like parents like daughter, the second-year BCom Law student at Varsity College is playing Zola on the SABC2 drama series Keeping Score.Lately, Madisakwane is featured on her father's Mzansi Magic reality show Living the Dream with Somizi.The series is about the life and times of the flamboyant dancer and choreographer."It was quite nerve-wrecking, I was overwhelmed by being on his popular show as daddy's girl. Now that we're shooting the fifth episode of a 13-part series, I'm getting used to it," says Madisakwane.She says she is "mapping my own journey and doing my own thing as I'm no longer vulnerable". "I'm mature to be allowed to put my personal touch in whatever I do."Madisakwane says she is determined not to live under her parents' shadow as she is into fashion design, runs a fashion blog and a campaign to help young girls realise their dreams.
