 This after the duo allegedly severed business ties over unknown irreconcilable differences.TS Records, which was once the powerhouse of kwaito, Afro-pop and commercial house music, was also being deregistered by the South African Companies &amp; Intellectual Property Commission after DJ Sbu and TK allegedly failed to submit their annual returns for more than five years.TK, who was a director in Sbu's energy drink MOFAYA, has also resigned from the company, ending their business partnership that spanned over 15 years.DJ Sbu, born Sibusiso Leope, was allegedly working with kwaito megastar Zola, whom he had roped into his new digital radio station Massiv Metro while TK, who is a regional treasurer of the ANC in Ekurhuleni region, has gone solo.The two parted ways after a mass exodus of their cash cow artists starting five years ago.TK's wife, Nhlanhla Nciza, left her husband's label after releasing only one album.The songbird started her own record label.The label's other artist Zahara also left allegedly after a fight with TK and Sbu over money.Zahara has also started her own record label but her products are marketed by CCP /Universal music.DJ Sbu confirmed he had not been plying his trade under the record label for a while and that TK resigned from MOFAYA Beverage Company (PTY) Ltd, which manufactures his energy drink MOFAYA."I can confirm that I have not been active in TS Records business affairs for while but it was not because TK and I fought. We are still OK as brothers. It's just that he wanted to concentrate on his political career and grow his other business ventures and I also wanted to concentrate on growing MOFAYA," he said.DJ Sbu also confirmed that TK resigned from his energy drink company.He also said he was not aware that TS Records was being deregistered but said he and TK would establish another record company if they signed other artists.TK could not be reached for comment at the time of going press as he ignored our phone calls and text messages.A former TS Records artist, who did not want to be named, said the demise of TK Records was a "sad story because it was viewed as the most successful black story".Some of the top artists that previously belonged to TS Records include the late Brown Dash, Brickz, Ntando, Prokid and Mzekezeke. ngwakom@sundayworld.co.za
