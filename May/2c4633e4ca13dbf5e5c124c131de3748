 They ve been going around in circles without chewing into anything tangible.Every time they seem to have dug themselves out of a hole one bad result knocks them back down.The Buccaneers will try to change that with their appearance in the Nedbank Cup final against SuperSport United at Moses Mabhida Stadium on June 24.But all the effort to get there will amount to nothing if they don't beat Matsatsantsa a Pitori.A loss in the final would further compound Pirates woes as they look set to miss out on finishing in the top eight for the first time in the club s history in the PSL-era.The club can still mathematically finish in the top eight but a lot of things need to happen for them to achieve that.Ajax Cape Town must not only lose to Baroka but that loss and the Buccaneers win over Golden Arrows need to make up the five goals the Sea Robbers trail Ajax with in the goal difference column.That s just the start.Platinum Stars also need to not win against SuperSport United.Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret spoke like he has already accepted finishing outside the top eight. It s not over until the fat lady sings."But I don t know if there are any fat ladies here."We should try to win the game against (Arrows) and then we look if the other results go our way."But we should have won against Ajax to stand a good chance. Let s just enjoy being in the final Jonevret said.A victory in the Nedbank Cup final would salvage the season for the Buccaneers and give the fans something to celebrate in the club s 80th anniversary.Success in that tournament would also see Pirates return to the CAF Confederation Cup a place they haven t been to since they lost in the final to Etoile du Sahel in 2015.Jonevret has already started looking into the future constantly talking about what they need to do in pre-season and setting a good foundation for the next campaign. This has been a troubled season Jonevret said. A lot of things have happened."I can understand that a lot of supporters and people around the club are disappointed."I hope that this (Nedbank Cup final appearance) moves us one step closer to better times. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
