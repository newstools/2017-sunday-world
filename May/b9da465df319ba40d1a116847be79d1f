 This is because Pailman believes the hard-hitting left-hander will have done a number on Andile Mabilisa at the Don Mateman Hall in Eldorado Park on May 26. "I know it sounds like hot air when I say he belongs in the top 10, but fans will see for themselves what I'm talking about," he said.Pailman made it clear that he was grooming a contender for the SA junior middleweight belt which is currently held by his former charge Nkululeko Mhlongo. The trainer warned that Mabilisa, who is guided by retired boxer Abram Lubisi in Mpumalanga - will receive nothing but punishment."I am sure of that," said Pailman, whose second champion Sipho Taliwe won the SA junior lightweight belt from Jasper Seroka in 2009.The trainer later guided Sydney Maluleka to victory for the national featherweight belt from Sabelo Jubatha in 2012 and, in August last year, Pailman guided Malcolm Klassen to victory for the IBO belt from Jack Asis - the Australia-based Filipino - who suffered his 19th loss against 35 wins and five draws.Pailman's Westside Boxing Academy in Westbury produced its first SA champion in 2004 when Baldwin Tshiakale pummelled defending cruiserweight champion Earl Morais into submission in nine rounds at Sun City.Pailman, who learnt the ropes - especially closing boxer's cuts - from the late Nick Durandt, was in the corner when Klassen won the IBF junior lightweight belt from Cassius Baloyi with a seventh-round stoppage in 2007.
