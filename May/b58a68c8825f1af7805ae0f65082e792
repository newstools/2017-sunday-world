 Teen acne is usually triggered by an increase in hormone levels which sends oil production into overdrive.To help prevent any long-term damage, focus on a regular routine of effective deep-pore cleansing.Avoid using skin aggravating ingredients that weaken the skin's protective barrier function and include a non-abrasive exfoliation system that both clarifies blocked pores and stimulates cell production.Make sure you cleanse and tone the skin twice a day to remove excess oils and dirt that could lead to blackheads and congestion.Regular exfoliation with a natural fruit acid is the preferred form of exfoliation.A light textured moisturiser is effective in reducing irritation.Schulte is founder of QMS Medicosmetics
