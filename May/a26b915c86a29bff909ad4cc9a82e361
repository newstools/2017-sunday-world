 Amakhosi were title contenders, but that has fallen apart especially in the last three matches.Chiefs conceded in injury time to lose 3-2 to Cape Town City two weeks ago and then conceded in the 90th minute to draw 2-2 with SuperSport United.As if that was not enough, Chiefs let it slip again by conceding in injury time to draw 1-1 with Golden Arrows at FNB Stadium at on Saturday.Substitute Ryan Moon had put Chiefs in the lead with 13 minutes remaining, but their defence was caught off guard and Knox Mutizwa equalised.Understandably, Komphela, usually a man of many words, found it difficult to explain the situation. "I'm very disappointed. It's not the first time and I don't know how many setbacks have we suffered like this. You can't. You don't learn from this and each time it happens you ask yourself why should it be happening so often," said Komphela."There was no reason for us not to manage that. Four minutes (of injury time) is gone and it is just maybe the last kick. Did it happen before? Several times," he noted.As soon as Chiefs conceded, their supporters started walking out in disappointment. Komphela acknowledged their frustration."I believe we haven't been fair with our supporters in the sense that moments like this erase everything they had seen in the match - and it is just sad."You can't just comprehend this. Maybe if it happened once, you say, 'Okay, we made a mistake'. But it has happened so consistently and you don't know why we should suffer such setbacks," he added.Chiefs next travel to Polokwane City on Saturday.
