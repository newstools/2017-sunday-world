 The Kisses hitmaker will be engaging at a higher level on the night of the awards as she will be performing at the inaugural Taboo UK Tour event with fellow South Africans B3nchMarQ, Dbn Nyts and DJ Rabs Vhafuwi.Fifi Cooper, real name Refiloe Mooketsi, said she will be leaving on Wednesday and will first perform in Dublin, Ireland, on Friday and Birmingham on Saturday and Sunday."I was invited to perform there before but I could not go because I was still under a record label," she said.She told Sunday World that she did not know why her previous record label did not let her take on the tour. "Maybe they had their own plans of pushing me as their artist."She said she is hopeful that the audience will receive her music positively as a lot of local artists tour the UK regularly and get good reception.The popular hip-hop star was booted out of Ambitiouz Entertainment early this year for allegedly bringing the name of the company into disrepute.B3nchMarQ's Phologo "PJ" Mataboge said they were also delighted with the opportunity to showcase their musical talent abroad."This is a big deal for us considering that we have been through a lot in the industry to be where we are today," he said.Shumaya hit-makers Dbn Nyts, a group of five young men from Durban, are also over the moon as it will be their first time in that part of the world.Group member Wanda "Choco" Tshabalala said they can't wait for the experience."We will make sure we leave them with good music and unforgettable dance moves."Popular music publicist and promoter Gastor Serumula said she put the event together in collaboration with her promoter contacts in the UK.
