 Matsatsantsa-a-Pitori will face the high-flying Cape Town City on May 9 as part of their five remaining fixtures.That game will be eagerly watched by Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits as the outcome will have an impact on their quest for league honours."We [the top five teams] are all playing each other," Tembo, SuperSport's assistant, said."I think that we also have a say in terms of who will win the league."We still have to play Cape Town City at home.SuperSport should have Stuart Baxter back in the bench against Bloemfontein Celtic at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow.Baxter missed the club's win over Bidvest Wits and draw with Kaizer Chiefs due to illness.Cape Town City lost 1-0 to Maritzburg United yesterday.Kurt Lentjies' 84th minute freekick decided the tie at Harry Gwala Stadium.With their loss, City fluffed a chance to return to the top .- TMG Digital
