 The Vul indlela hitmaker is one of the greatest entertainers to come out of South Africa and while she may be gone she has left us with plenty legendary moments. Ma Brrr s interviews were always lit and her performances actual flames. Here are three of our best Brenda Fassie moments: Her legendary 1985 Ellis Park stadium performance. See how packed it was! That time she set the bar very high when she performed for the late Nelson Mandela. Interview on entertainment show Selimathunzi where she said I have no competition . RIP Brenda Fassie https://t.co/xz4MZvGF95
