 What about if they speak non-stop while you are trying to follow the dialogue between the skop skiet and donner?One Texas man got so ticked off when his date refused to stop texting during a movie he is suing her for the price of the movie ticket.According to a report by the Austin American-Statesman 37-year-old Brandon Vezmar of Round Rock Texas filed a claim with the US equivalent of the Small Claims Court for $17.31 (around R230) last week.Vezmar who runs a communications consulting firm told reporter Claire Osborn the money was what it cost him for a 3D ticket to watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 at Barton Creek Square theatre.He said he met the woman online and they went on their first date on May 6. It was kind of a first date from hell the report quoted him as saying.He said his date started texting about 15 minutes into the movie which was one of his biggest pet peeves .In the claim he filed Vezmar says she activated her phone at least 10-20 times in 15 minutes to read and send text messages .He says he asked her to stop and when she refused he told her maybe she could go outside to text.She left and never came back.The woman did not wish to be named the report continued and she had no idea about the claim. Oh my God she said. This is crazy. She says she only texted two or three times with her friend who was having a fight with her boyfriend. I had my phone low and I wasn t bothering anybody she is quoted as saying. It wasn t like constant texting. She would also be filing a protective order against Vezmar because he had contacted her sister also to ask for a refund.In his court papers he said the texting was a direct violation of the theatre s policy and his date adversely affected Vezmar s viewing experience .He said the damages sought were modest but it was the principle that was important as the woman s behaviour is a threat to civilized society .
