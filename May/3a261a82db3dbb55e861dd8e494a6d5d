 Komphela still has one full season to run on his contract, but he has to make sure he delivers if he entertains the thought of getting a contract extension.Chiefs are currently in fifth place - the same position they finished in last season - due to their inconsistent performances."Contractually he has another season with us. We cannot just decide overnight that he should go. If we do that, then it means we are working against ourselves. If we had that in mind, then we should have started working towards that. Chopping and changing coaches can also hurt you badly," said Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung yesterday."The season has been disappointing. We have not achieved what we wanted to achieve. We need to have a proper review of everything. Once we've done the review, we'll see where things could have gone wrong and where we did not do what we should have done."Having recently conceded late goals in three consecutive matches, Motaung says they will look to strengthen the defence."We've been let down by defensive glitches in the end. It has not done us any good. We might be [strengthening that department] because you can see that the legs of some of the players are gone."Amakhosi yesterday announced a three-year sponsorship deal with medical aid company Medshield. It's a deal of about R6-million a year."It's worth between R5-million and R6-million, but the cash component is R3 million and the rest is going through their products the staff and players will derive from," said Motaung.Chiefs travel to Polokwane City tomorrow.
