Acting is something I wanted to do later on."It's a huge challenge, but with such an incredible cast, I'm learning from everybody."I'm shooting everyday. ... I have to do my radio show in the morning, then go for the shooting of Harvest late morning and on Thursdays I'm on Craz-e.The Knysna, Western Cape-born Seyisi came to Jozi to study law in 2012 but found a job as a presenter immediately after dropping out of university. mtshazox@sundayworld.co.za
