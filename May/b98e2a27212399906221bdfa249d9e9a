 Matsatsantsa play Chippa United in the semifinal, at Sisa Dukashe Stadium tomorrow (3pm), the teams second meeting this week.Baxter will also be out for revenge after his side suffered a 3-0 loss against Chippa United in a PSL fixture on Wednesday."We are the cup holders and we would be the first team to have defended the title," Baxter said."It's important to win things. We have had a very good season but to make it a great season you have to win something."In that respect as professionals it's important because we would set a record by being the first team to retain it," he said.The Pretoria side had several of its key players - Thuso Phala, Onismor Bhasera and Reneilwe Letsholonyane - suspended for the league encounter against Chippa.The former Kaizer Chiefs coach said it was part of his plan to rest some of the players for semifinal."When you are in the modern game and you have important games you want to try and rotate the squad under control."But it doesn't always work because I had a player who tried to get a yellow card but he got a red card and I had player who was trying to get a yellow but he couldn't because the referee was very kind to him."Baxter said he had seen the field and was concerned about its condition but added that both teams would be playing on the same surface."It's not the best pitch we are going to get that day so we will take that into account, but I don't think we should not be scared of it," he said.
