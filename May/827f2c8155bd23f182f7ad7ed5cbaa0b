 Research is now revealing that experiences with touch - especially in infancy - do indeed shape brain development.This was recently demonstrated by a team of researchers, led by Nathalie Maitre, at the Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. The researchers fitted 125 babies' heads with electrodes and recorded their brain activity while their skin was lightly touched.First, they recorded the typical brain response to touch in full-term babies (babies born on or after 37 weeks of pregnancy). They then recorded the brain activity of babies born prematurely (before 37 weeks). Premature and full-term babies were matched by age.Compared with full-term babies, premature babies showed reduced brain activity when touched. That is, different parts of the brain became active at different times when touched.The researchers also showed, for the first time, that for premature babies the quality of touch while in hospital after birth (typically around one month) affected the functioning of the babies' brains. When they tested the premature babies, just before they were discharged, they found that the more they experienced pleasant, nurturing touch (such as breast-feeding or skin contact) the greater the brain response. Conversely, unpleasant touch, such as skin punctures and tube insertions, were associated with reduced brain activity.This demonstrates that sensory experiences in early life have important effects on brain function. Maitre's findings add to the growing understanding that the functioning of the brain cannot be considered separately to that of the body.The link with autism:Another study that highlights how early experiences with touch can shape the brain and behaviour in later life was published in Cell last year. This work, by researchers at Harvard University, found an association between hypersensitive touch in mice pups and psychological problems that resemble aspects of autism.The researchers caused mutations of genes associated with autism in the skin of mice, causing hypersensitivity and a change in texture perception.These psychological effects were only seen when touch was altered in young - but not adult - mice.Overwhelming tactile sensations during a child's exploration of the world might cause them to withdraw, leading to delays in language development and social skills.Dempsey-Jones is postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford.
