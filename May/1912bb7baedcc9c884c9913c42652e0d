 The annual awards took place at the Sun City Superbowl in North West. Mhlongo, who was one of the hosts, joked about Zahara. "We are almost at the end of the show. There is an amazing after-party, where is Zahara? ... useke bar [Is she already at the bar]?"However, Mhlongo said yesterday: "I only mentioned the bar and her name, not alcohol. But if that offended her I am sorry. I did not mean to hurt or harm her. It was just a joke."Askies Zahara, I was just having fun. I joked about a lot of people, including Khanyi Mbau that she was white. I made a joke about Babes Wodumo and she was laughing."Zahara had taken to social media announcing her intentions to sue both Mhlongo and the Samas."I don't know if this was a scripted comment or if it came directly from Somizi. But I'm preparing to file a lawsuit against Sama and Somizi himself. They will work it out among themselves as to who was at fault for the disrespectul comment," the musician told Sowetan yesterday.
