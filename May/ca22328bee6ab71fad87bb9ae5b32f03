I was on some I don t like what is going on right now and I am not going to put up with it anymore because I am great at what I do she said.She said it was important for her to bow out gracefully .There was speculation shortly before Unathi s departure that she was not happy with being paired with Khanyi Mbau on a mid-morning show during the radio reshuffle.Unathi did not go into any more details about her decision to leave only saying that she was not angry at the station s bosses but pitied them because they do not know what it s like to be a DJ. Hate is a strong word. I pity them.
