"There is a lot that I know now that I will avoid because I saw them while backing."Thabsie said starting out as a backing vocalist helped her because she had to watch how the industry works from the background. "I think there is a lot of things that I know now that I will avoid because I saw them while backing. I was absorbing and taking notes," she said.She said she learned that as an artist she should keep her personal life personal and keep her circle of friends small. "When you get into the industry, it's different from when you are watching from a distance."She has backed for the likes of Donald, ProVerb, Khuli Chana, Cassper Nyovest and Black Motion. Biyela, 25, who is a BCom Economics graduate from UJ, recently released a single called Cry.She said she wrote the song after someone broke her heart."When I wrote the song I was going though emotional stress, so the song is like an open letter to the person who broke my heart," she said.She said her music is different from everything that has been done musically, which is what sets her apart.Thabsie described her music as new-school R&amp;B where she has smooth vocals on heavy hip-hop beats. Her debut album will be released before the end of the year, she says.
