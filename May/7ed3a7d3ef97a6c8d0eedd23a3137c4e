 Babes told TshisaLIVE she is excited for her BET nomination because it showed her that not being able to speak English fluently has nothing to do with producing great music. I think that this nomination proved to other people that me speaking Zulu has not closed doors but instead opened them for me. I didn t have to speak English to be recognised by BET she said.The musician who has been dubbed a national treasure by her fans is the only South African female artist nominated in the category and locals AKA and Nasty C join her in the competition. Babes Wodumo's friend burnt with acid during 'abduction attempt' BET nomination is a big deal such an honour. As the first SA female nominee representing eThekwini all the way in America this needs to be celebrated. I feel like the municipality should have a celebration for me Babes said.She said that she may even get to perform on one of the stages outside the main venue and if that is the case Mampintsha would be her support and back-up dancer Babes explained that she is not worried about whether the audience that side understands what she is saying because the music will impress them. She joked that she might even get to rub shoulders with big U.S stars. My music and dance leaves people happy so I will impress them with that. Above that I am a proud Zulu girl and that won t change. Look at me now I may even be chilling next to Rick Ross she said.Babes has gone through a lot of abuse for choosing to speak Zulu in the past and for not being fluent in English.
