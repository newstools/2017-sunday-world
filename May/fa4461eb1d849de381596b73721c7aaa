 Mokoena joined the Urban Warriors in August seeking to reignite a stalled career after leaving Sundowns at the end of the last campaign where he had not made a single league start in two seasons.But things have not worked out again for the 30-year-old who has made just two starts this campaign the last in October.His only appearance since then was off the bench against Highlands Park last month. I get a lot of questions about Lebohang and I don t really know why we have other players who are not playing as well Menzo says. I know he is a big player but I use players where I think I can use them and if I am honest and Lebohang is a good player but if I had to put him in the team right now I don t know where I would use him. That is my biggest question Menzo said. I want to use a player in his strength not his weakness. He is not the fastest any more or the strongest so coming into a team that has been struggling it is not easy as a coach to put him in. He came on against Highlands Park and he did well but as a coach you have to look for a good balance. That is the same for every player who is not regularly playing at the moment. Mokoena is a former Bafana Bafana international who won the last of his eight caps five years ago and a mixture of injury and an inability to break into a star-studded Sundowns side has seen his career derailed at a time when he should perhaps be at his peak.Mokoena was a league champion with Sundowns in the 2013/14 season the last time he found some regular game time. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
