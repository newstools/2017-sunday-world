 Her successor Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana blew the whistle on the allegations that her predecessor received a salary for six months after her death.The late MEC not only received a salary, she also allegedly ordered expensive dishes to the tune of R68 000 in August last year, two months after her death.Matshoge died in a car crash while she was driving alone in Limpopo in June last year.The shocking details of her continued posthumous remuneration were uncovered by Mokaba-Phukwana after she joined the department following a provincial cabinet reshuffle by premier Stan Mathabatha.Sunday World understands that as a result of the discovery, Matshoge's secretary Matete Duba was kicked out of the MEC's office by Mokaba-Phukwana allegedly for hiding Matshoge's pay slips from July until December.This allegedly happened after Mokaba-Phukwana stumbled upon Matshoge's December pay slip when signing off documents in her office.Senior departmental officials revealed that on the discovery, she allegedly ordered Duba's removal from her office.At the time of her death, Matshoge earned an annual salary of R1.8-million.The MEC then reported the matter to the provincial legislature's standing committee on public accounts (Scopa), led by Snowy Kennedy-Monyemoratho for investigation.Kennedy-Monyemoratho confirmed that she was informed of the matter by Mokaba-Phukwana.However, Kennedy-Monyemoratho told Sunday World they could not deal with the matter as it was within the MEC's powers to institute an internal investigation and involve law enforcement agencies to help investigate the allegations as they were serious."The MEC brought the matter to us, but we could not interrogate it because we only deal with AG [auditor-general] reports."We advised the MEC to institute an investigation as the matter falls within her powers to investigate or even call the Hawks because the allegations were very serious," she said .On allegations of posthumous salary payments, she said: "If it's true, the department must recoup the money because the continuation to draw salary was 'fraud' by those using the MEC's name to steal from the department."Mokaba-Phukwana's spokesman Joel Seabe confirmed the department was looking into the issues but said they should not be interpreted as the MEC's witch-hunt into the affairs of her predecessors.Duba confirmed that the dishes were procured by Matshoge's office but the process started before the MEC died.
