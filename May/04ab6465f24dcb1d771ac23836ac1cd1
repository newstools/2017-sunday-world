 Hugh s manager Josh Georgiou told TshisaLIVE that the 78-year-old musician was optimistic that the medical procedure to repair tendon and ligament damage in his shoulder would go well. We are waiting for the go-ahead from the doctors but he should go in for surgery in the next day or two. He s absolutely fine. He s not nervous at all. He will be in the hands of a great medical team and will be back on the road soon Josh said.Josh explained that Hugh irritated an injury he sustained in 1993 when he fell at an event in Morocco last month. Hugh was in a lot of discomfort and we thought it might sort itself out but it soon became clear that we could not rush his recovery from the fall. We spoke to doctors and decided that it was better to take it easy and get it sorted now than to rush it and irritate the injury further Josh explained.After the surgery the musician will then be on a six-to-eight-week recovery break and is hopeful of returning to the stage in August. We have had to cancel several shows and Hugh is extremely disappointed that he let his fans down. We are one hundred% sure that he will be fine by August Josh added.While Hugh who has enjoyed a 60-year career has slowed down his work schedule in recent years he has no plans to retire just yet. He still loves making music and will continue for a while longer. He has set up several organisations and foundations to support and keep him busy when he finally decides to call it a day but there are no plans for him to retire at the moment Josh said.
