 One of the mysteries Baxter could have solved when he last week named his team to face Nigeria was the continued overlooking of players who perform well in clubs based outside Gauteng.His inclusion of Aubrey Ngoma, of Cape Town City, was quite refreshing but he undid all that by picking Thamsanqa Gabuza. His presence in the national set-up has always been a mystery.The Orlando Pirates striker has only recently bounced back into reckoning for selection at club level, having started the season as a benchwarmer when Tendai Ndoro hit early form.But apparently due to his "hard work", Gabuza convinced Kjell Jonevret, the Pirates coach, that he should start. Baxter, too, has been sold.Indeed Gabuza performed admirably this year, not least in the Nedbank Cup where he helped Pirates qualify for the June 24 final against SuperSport United.But the question should be posed as to whether Gabuza, with his wretched stats from the just-concluded season, would have been chosen for the national side had he not been playing for a "big" Gauteng team.Compare his contribution to that of Rodney Ramagalela of Polokwane City.A likeable fellow, Ramagalela has been consistent all season, starting 29 of City's 30 league games and contributing nine goals.Now, if Baxter was looking for a real hard worker, Ramagalela is one striker who tracks back when possession is lost, helps in defence during set-piece situations and proves a handful for many a defender.At 28, Ramagalela is also two years younger than Gabuza so, if Baxter was genuinely looking for an alternative, he should have considered him given that he can offer more in the coming few years."I want a big lad. Gabuza is a player that has physical presence," Baxter said last week, justifying his absurd selection.That physical presence has produced just two goals in 19 league appearances, in a team who had their worst season in PSL history.Selecting Gabuza on the basis of his physicality, or stats in the national team (13 matches, six goals) serves as discouragement to those who really deserve selection, such as Ramagalela.There was a time, a few years ago, when Gabuza was truly worth a place in the side. Not this time.
