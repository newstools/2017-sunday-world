 The committee plans to disqualify Malinga's album titled Robbie Malinga, which was nominated in the Best Afro-pop Album category.At issue is that the album did not meet the Samas nomination requirements as it comprises songs lifted from albums of various artists he produced.The committee is expected to take a decision before the event is held at Sun City on May 26.
