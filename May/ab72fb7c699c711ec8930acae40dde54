 He is Themba Kubheka, the chairman of Orange Farm United Taxi Association (Ofuta) in Gauteng's Sedibeng District Municipality in the Vaal.He said as the minibus taxi industry has the ability to transport an estimated 15million people across the country daily, it is the number one transport of choice for the masses.The industry is getting a facelift, with the Gauteng government helping taxi organisations send their executive members for leadership classes at the Wits Business School.Kubheka said the industry should improve its image among its stakeholders by conducting its business affairs in a professional manner.To demonstrates his willingness to put Ofuta on the map, Kubheka said the association built and opened its head office at the taxi rank years ago.His immediate task as chairman was to address the issue of low salaries paid to queue marshals and drivers, and he has single-handedly instructed Ofuta's office to pay better salaries to employees."I emphasise that no one must earn a salary that is not in line with market trends because we are now operating like corporate entities. As a matter of fact, there is no queue marshal who earns less than R500 a week," said Kubheka.He was elected last year to this position following the death of chairman Alpheus Mchunu, whom he worked under as treasurer.Kubheka is well aware of the monetary value attached to the minibus taxi industry. In 2015 the industry's contribution to the country's GDP was estimated at R39-billion."In South Africa, the taxi industry is the biggest and only vehicle through which the true meaning of black economic empowerment makes sense."The mere fact that government has helped us enroll for leadership courses shows the importance of the taxi business within the economic landscape of the country."Kubheka was staying in Orlando West, Soweto, in 1985. While searching for a job, he was approached by taxi owner William Hlongwane - his landlord. "The old man asked me to drive his taxi. I warmed up to my new job. I loved it and spent six years in it."He left Hlongwane in 1992 to join a new group of taxi owners.Before his retirement from the taxi industry, Kubheka wants to see members from Ofuta being involved in other transport business spheres like buses and fuel filling stations.Kubheka owns an animal farm and a towing company - Totally Connected Services.
