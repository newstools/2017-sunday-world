 Moseamedi netted with a header just past the hour-mark to move City to within two points of leaders BidVest Wits though they have played a game more than the Johannesburg side.Moseamedi who started the game in an unfamiliar right-wing role was excellent throughout and also laid on two superb chances for Aubrey Ngoma that were spurned.The 23-year-old was given the nod in the team ahead of the more experienced Lehlohonolo Majoro and repaid Tinkler s faith in him. Judas worked extremely hard tonight. We started him out of the right as an experiment and he had a fantastic performance over the 90 minutes Tinkler said. He did very very well. He was causing them issues although we could have tried to utilise him more especially with the diagonal ball because you know they had [defender Sifiso] Mbhele who really couldn t match him for aerial ability or pace. We noticed in the second half that we needed to make a change up-front and he went into a more central position and worked his socks off for 94 minutes and was fantastic. Tinkler says the club s minimum aim in the last three matches of the season is to finish third and claim a place in the African Confederation Cup for next season. Anything beyond that he says would be a bonus. Right now we were sitting in third and we need to finish the season in this position at least. If we can finish higher that s great but unfortunately that relies on others. Wits need to drop points Sundowns too. If we could finish third it would be a phenomenal achievement. City also claimed the Telkom Knockout trophy in December in what has been a fairytale first season in the Premier Soccer League for the newly-formed club.Their next opponents are SuperSport United away on Tuesday the side they defeated in that cup final. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
