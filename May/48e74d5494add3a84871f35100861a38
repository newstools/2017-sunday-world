 This comes after she signed a long-term contract with the producers of e.tv's wedding-planning telenovela Broken Vows."It's unlike me, I like my freedom to do whatever I want to, travelling abroad for other filming commitments if I have to. I don't like to be pinned to long-term contracts," she said."I suppose it was because of the magnitude of the production itself. The Broken Vows cast I'm working with has all the big-name actors. I had no choice but to commit."I also don't want to be typecast, I carefully choose the roles I play and strive by all means to bring the human element in every character to get the viewers buy in."Relating how she got to play the role of the sexy and stylish Lulama, Ben-Mazwi, 27, said she did what all actors do during the auditioning phase and killed it."During the auditions late last year, I put my best foot forward. Initially it was for the role of Thandi, played by Jo-Anne Reyneke. But it seems the producers had other ideas."When I was called back I was informed I was suited to play Lulama, a typical girl in her 20s who is trying to find her feet. She has her insecurities and wants to live happily ever after. Her aspiration is to become a designer."Indeed, the Port Elizabeth-born UCT graduate's travels around the world do not resonate with long-term contracts. Playing Nandi in the film Madiba, she was invited by her co-star and Hollywood actor Lawrence Fishburne for a "barbecue" at his house in Los Angeles, Carlifonia, in the US.Ben-Mazwi, whose uncle is renowned veteran actor Winston Ntshona, made her local drama debut in the Mzansi Magic series Doubt last year and was previously on eKasi+ police procedural series Traffic!.She has filmed in Egypt, she's MCed the 2010 Fifa World Cup, has done TV and radio commercials, was presenter of SABC3's Weekend Edition and stood in for others on their shows, including on GoodHope FM and on SABC3's Top Billing.To top it all, Ben-Mazwi has lived in New York, in the US, and recently started her own production company.
