The duo have been invited to play at H Ibiza later this month and are looking forward to flying the flag high. First of all a big shout out to DJ Black Coffee who always takes time to open doors for us. We have played in some awesome places around the globe but I ll admit that H Ibiza the party capital of the world is a very exciting opportunity for us Thabo said.The duo s album Ya Badimo has received general praise great air play and plenty of awards including a SAMA for Best Duo/Group of the Year and Best Dance Album.The pair said they are in the process of preparing for their international gig to make sure they leave their mark. It is amazing to be able to introduce them to our sound so to prepare we are busy mixing tracks making sure they are relevant to that market but they are also a true refection of who we are. It is going to be one of the most amazing sets of all time from us they said.Black Coffee announced his residency at the club back in February.
