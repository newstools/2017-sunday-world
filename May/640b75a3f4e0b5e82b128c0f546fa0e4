 "The General" has paid tribute to the Clever Boys for last week winning their first league title since the club was formed in 1921."We [Sundowns] should have won the league a long time ago. We had opportunities to be on top, to open a gap but we couldn't," Modise told Sowetan. "Of course, it's difficult to accept, because we wanted to win. But I have to be professional enough and congratulate Wits for their persistence all these years. They have always challenged to win the league by featuring in the top three several times."The 34-year-old says the Brazilians cannot be emotional about coming second best."You can't win everything, God loves us all. As much as we pray, they also pray," he said."We are looking forward to the next season to compete again."Modise may not even be with Sundowns next season after making only 19 appearances this season. His contract is expiring at the end of next month."It would have been selfish of me to speak to my coach about giving me game time when the team was doing so well," Modise said.
