 "Ace" has insisted that the Buccaneers are focused on their own race, which is getting into the top eight. That's something to play for, because Pirates and SuperSport United are the only teams never to have been out of the top eight in the PSL era - from 1996/97.The reality, though, is that Pirates also have a score to settle with title chasers like log leaders Bidvest Wits, who they meet at Bidvest Stadium tonight (7.30pm). Bucs have lost twice to the Clever Boys this season, including in the MTN8.The same goes for second- placed Mamelodi Sundowns, who they meet on Sunday. Sundowns hammered Pirates 6-0 in the league in February.But it's Wits first in the resurgent Pirates' firing line. Manyisa, however, wasn't interested in talking about Pirates as potential party spoilers."... the only thing on our minds is us doing well and seeing where we end up when the season is over. We have nothing to prove," he said.Pirates will have to improve their away form if they are to overcome Wits. They have played 12 league matches away; winning only two, drawing six and losing four. Wits, meanwhile, boast nine wins, a draw and just two losses on their own turf in 12 league matches.Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret is confident his charges can upset Wits, having played better in recent times."Bidvest [Wits] and Sundowns are the two best teams right now in the league, so it's going to be a test for us," Jonevret acknowledged."We are going to be underdogs in these games, but at the same time we feel okay."
