 The 'Caiphus Song' hit-maker has just been nodded for a third consecutive time in the category 'Best International Act: Africa'.Last year he lost out to fellow South African artist DJ Black Coffee, while in 2015 Ghanaian superstar Stonebwoy bagged the award.AKA expressed his excitement at a special announcement party yesterday at the African Pride Hotel, in Melrose Arch, Johannesburg."It does mean a lot to me, because this is a very important platform - BET's presence here in Africa, especially in South Africa. Last year I spoke to Monde Twala [Vice President for BET, Youth &amp; Music], at the actual awards in Los Angeles, about the future of it and where it's going," AKA said."Africa right now as a whole, from Nigeria to South Africa, we are putting our mark on the rest of the world. For me I feel like this is the first step in terms of one day having a 'Best African' category at the Grammys."Two other South African artists have received nominations in the category. Self-proclaimed gqom queen Babes Wodumo and rapper Nasty C have made the cut.A flabbergasted Babes Wodumo was lost for words as the room was set roaring as attendees started chanting 'Wololo' after she was announced as the only female in the category."I'm so grateful, thank you to BET, I wasn't expecting it. I think I deserve it, I have worked really hard," Babes Wodumo kept it short and simple.Four Nigerian musicians - Wizkid, Tekno, Davido and Mr Eazi - have dominated the category. Stonebwoy from Ghana complete the list.
