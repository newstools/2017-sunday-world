 According to sexperts, adult shop owners and couples, the mirror has increased in popularity and is the one thing to have if you're the kinky type.It's said to be like starring in your very own exotic film and can be used by both a voyeur and an exhibitionist.Mirror sex, also known as katoptronophilia, has been deemed as the most stimulating experience during sex, according to sexperts.Luvland's Patric Meyer says most of the adult shop customers prefer having sex in front of the mirror because they enjoy seeing their reactions to the joys of sex."When you have sex in front of mirrors, you see yourself from the same perspective your partner sees you while still physically feeling his or her touch. You get to feel pleasure from receiving it from your partner, as well as by watching yourself react to that pleasure."Mirrors were a major drawcard at the recent Sexpo held at the Sandton Convention centre in Johannesburg.The larger the better, as almost every stall was selling them.Meyer says: "I think it has become something most couples are getting used to. Most of them rate mirrors as fun to have," says Meyer.Naughty But Nice adult boutique's regional manager Andre Korofman says though their most sold item has been the vibrator, times are changing."The idea of watching yourself and partner in action has become one of the most stimulating toys in the sex world," says Korofman.We polled readers about their experiences when it comes to dancing in front of the mirror.Bridgette Makhela, a senior log editor at a radio station, says having coitus in front of the mirror is a huge turn on."It's actually so hot watching yourself and your partner getting it on in front of the mirror, especially if it's full length," says Makhela.She says the image heightens the sexual experience."The mirror is kind of a tool you can use to show each other what you are capable of doing in the bedroom. And oh, watching each other's facial expressions in the mirror is also a big plus," says Makhela.Dumisane Hlophe says it is also about how open-minded your partner is."I have met partners who thought I was a freak to want to have sex in front of mirrors."He says he finally met a woman who understood, and mirrors became their way of knowing more about each other sexually."I get to see how shy my girlfriend is. I think I would still want to have sex in front of mirrors when I'm married. It is fun, and it keeps the flames burning in the relationship."Nothando Mbatha says: "You are experiencing the visual manifestation of your fantasy unfold in front of your very eyes in real life. That is what makes it amazing."But, she says, when you meet a new person it is not that easy."I have decided to put the mirror in my room opposite my bed to get a full view."I remember I used to get frustrated when my ex kept moving me away from the view of the mirror."phaladib@sundayworld.co.za
