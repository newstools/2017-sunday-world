 But by the time Bidvest Wits left Bethlehem, the youngsters were smiling again.That was after they heard the news that Mamelodi Sundowns had dropped two vital points by playing to a 2-2 draw with Baroka."That loss hurt us a lot," Ntshangase said. "We were emotional not just because we had lost but because we knew the feeling of losing the league at this time."Two points clear at the top, Wits have a chance to clinch the Premiership for the first time in their history, should they beat Polokwane City tonight and Sundowns fail to win at home to Maritzburg United."It happened to us last season. We weren't hurt just for the club and the fans, but also for ourselves because winning the league is our dream," Ntshangase said."We thought that we had lost it because we knew that there was no way Sundowns wouldn't beat Baroka, especially at this stage."Losing this league would hurt a lot for Ntshangase because the dynamic central midfielder has been a part of the team's transformation in the past three seasons from a mid-table side to league contenders who even play consistently in the CAF Champions League.The Clever Boys are guaranteed to return to the Champions League next year as they will finish in the top two. But they want to win the league."That loss was a wake-up call for us," Ntshangase said. - TMG Digital
