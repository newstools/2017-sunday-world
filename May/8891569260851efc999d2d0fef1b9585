 The musician became an overnight sensation when she wore a revealing yellow dress to the Metro FM Music Awards earlier this year.So Skolopad made sure she maintained that standard this past weekend.Skolopad stole the show with her odd poses on the carpet and her signature see my butt tattoo pose which she credits as inspiration for her design. I designed the outfit and at the last minute Monadecious [Designs] did it for me. I didn t go with yellow because I didn t want to be predictable but of course my butt tattoo had to show so my serope ka ntle (thigh out) design was born she said.She wore a peach semi-nude jumpsuit complete with a lace bodice and flowing chiffon draping over her shoulder.Skolopad said the garment cost R7 500 but the local designer from Qwa Qwa sponsored her and brought her design to life.
