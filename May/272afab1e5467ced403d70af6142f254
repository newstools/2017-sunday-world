 In the two matches Kaizer Chiefs conceded late goals recently, it was clear they missed their goalkeeper and captain Itumeleng Khune.Those late goals, first in a 3-2 defeat to Cape Town City and then a 2-2 draw with SuperSport United, all but ended Amakhosi's hopes of winning the Absa Premiership title.There's no guarantee Chiefs would not have conceded those goals had Khune been around, but the Bafana Bafana number one is yet to concede a goal after the 80th minute this season.Khune, who was replaced by young Bruce Bvuma in the matches he missed, is available for selection for the league encounter against Golden Arrows at FNB Stadium tomorrow (8.15pm) after returning from a hip injury.One person who has been concerned about the club's defending of late is left-back Tsepo Masilela, who has called for improvements ahead of the Arrows encounter.Even though Chiefs' chances of winning the title are slim, Masilela believes there's a lot to play for."It's not difficult to stay motivated. If you don't finish No 1, then you can finish in position two and qualify for the Champions League," Masilela said,"If you finish third, you still qualify to play in Africa [Confed Cup]. So we are still motivated. There's everything to play for."Coach Steve Komphela confirmed Khune should be available for selection tomorrow.
