 Sunday World has learnt that Khumalo will soon be baptised to become a born-again Christian and member of Motsoeneng's Incredible Happenings Ministries church.Khumalo, who was recently admitted to hospital after collapsing while recording the hit song Yile Gqom with DJ Cleo, rocked up at Mboro's church in Katlehong on the East Rand last week and begged for prayers.Khumalo confirmed she has turned to Mboro for divine intervention and that he will baptise her."As you know that I'm a sickly person who is supposed to undergo an operation on June 11 at the (Chris Hani) Baragwanath (Academic) Hospital, I decided to go there for prayers because I believe that people's gifts are different."They prayed for me and I'm now feeling a bit better. I may not even go for that operation because my health is improving everyday as I keep on praying with Ntate Mboro."He will also baptise me. It is another way of coming closer to God and to grow spiritually," Khumalo said.She believed she was under siege from evil spirits who want to derail her career. "Sometimes you have no choice but to think that this is caused by black magic. How come I get sick every time I release a new song? I hope if this is the work of evil spirits, then prayers will banish them."Motsoeneng said he had put Khumalo in what he calls "49 Days of Journey with Mboro" to pray with her."She has indicated that she wants to be baptised as part of her spiritual growth and be closer to God. It will happen very soon, we are just making preparations with other senior members of the church," he said.Khumalo's visit to the church followed that of other well-known personalities like Brickz, Mshoza, Tsekeleke, Mapaputsi as well as former Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza.
