 May Mahlangu became the latest player to pick up silverware when he played for Romanian side Dinamo Bucharest in the final of the country s League Cup competition.They were heavy favourites for the win and so it proved as they brushed aside ACS Poli Timi oara to give the Bafana Bafana midfielder another victory in his career with a Swedish League title and two Swedish Cups with Helsingborg.Mahlangu has been a regular with Dinamo in his first season in Romania and can look forward to competing in the UEFA Europa League next campaign.Young striker Kurt Abrahams could join him after his hat-trick for Sint Truiden helped the Belgian side to a 7-0 win over Mechelen.Abrahams was only introduced just after the hour-mark but netted three times for his first goals as a professional.Sint Truiden will now take on Genk over two legs and if they win that advance to meet Andile Jali s KV Oostende in a final play-off for a place in the Europa League next season.Jali played for Oostende as they lost 3-2 to champions Anderlecht and finish the season in fourth.There was heartache for Kermit Erasmus though despite him scoring his first goal since he moved to France 18 months ago.He netted in a 3-1 win for Lens over Niort that looked as though it would be enough to get them into the promotion play-offs.But a 96th-minute winner by Emmanuel Bourgaud for Amiens saw them defeat Reims 2-1 and go above Lens leaving the club to spend another season in the second-tier.Erasmus has now confirmed he will head back to parent club Stade Rennes at the completion of his loan. I would like to say a big thank you to Lens for giving me the opportunity to wear the famous blood and gold shirt Erasmus wrote on Instagram on Sunday. I enjoyed every minute of my time at the club. Thanks to our amazing supporters for your amazing support it was always special to play at the Bollard in front of a full stadium. I m disappointed we could [not] win promotion because I believe a big club like Lens deserves to play at the highest level with our amazing supporters. Next season is another opportunity to make that possible. Thanks to the president coaching staff and all members involved at the club for believing in me to be part of this amazing club.
