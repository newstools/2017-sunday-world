 Former coach Shakes Mashaba was scrutinised for not making trips overseas to check on the progress of players and often relied on information he would get on his desk about European-based players.Baxter, though, says he will make an effort to visit players. This is encouraging, seeing that the likes of Kamohelo Mokotjo, Bongani Zungu, Dino Ndlovu, Kermit Erasmus, Luther Singh, Thabo Cele and Keagan Dolly have promising careers in Europe."Yes, I will be going to watch the players because I believe all South Africans deserve an opportunity of impressing their national coach."They will be given a fair chance. They will have to be playing. They must not be playing in the reserves every week," said Baxter."I will make the effort."Does it mean I will be abroad more than at home? No, it doesn't."What has changed is that the PSL is more competitive now. I think we have closed the gap on players playing abroad and players playing here. But I will be making trips."Baxter left a job that has much less pressure at SuperSport United, but he lives for demanding challenges such as the one of coaching a national team.This is Baxter's second spell with Bafana, having coached the team between 2004 and 2005."If you are looking for safe, then you shouldn't be a football coach. When I came in the first place [to South Africa in 2004], it was in the hope of doing something in the longer period of time."For whatever reason the country was not receptive. [But] we have an organisation that has recognised the importance of development."Baxter's first game in charge will be the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Nigeria in Uyo on June 10.
