 Born Tumelo Rakumako, Big Star, who recently released a single called Flavours featuring Reason, said given the chance he would go back to study music."Pursue your dreams and study what you want to work towards. I wish I studied music because I think I would be further with my artistry."Getting the papers for your passion is one way I think you will be truly happy," said the 25-year-old artist.He told Sunday World he studied media and communications at Monash University because it was close to what he wanted to be at the time - a media personality.He said music had been part of his life throughout his childhood."I played a few musical instruments in primary school and in varsity I was part of a band."In 2014 he recorded his first song and won hip-hop competition Vuzu Hustle the next year."My music is not like your normal hip-hop, it has colour and it's realistic. I don't rap about fancy cars, I rap about real life situations," he said. khalianyanel@sundayworld.co.za
