 Comitis lashed out at Mosimane for allegedly tapping his star player Aubrey Ngoma. He also accused the club of flouting the Fifa rules by directly making contact with the player."Pitso has made a direct approach to Ngoma offering him hypothetical millions to join Sundowns next year. This phone call and deal was made directly to Aubrey ... days before our crucial away match with Maritzburg [two weeks ago, which they lost 1-0]," noted Comitis, who suggested this destabilised their camp."This tactic from Sundowns is a poor reflection of their brand and how they destabilise other clubs, considering that we are competing in a title race," the strong-worded statement continued.Ironically, Comitis's statement was released to the media hours before Sundowns played Baroka last night.Sundowns spokesman Thulani Thuswa said: "I've consulted with the club's legal team and as it stands, we are not going to entertain the statement especially on the day when we have such an important match," Thuswa told Sowetan.Mosimane could be dealt with harshly if there is concrete evidence that he flouted the rules. He was not available for comment as he was in camp.Comitis had earlier told Sowetan that City were not in the business of servicing other teams while weakening their own.City head coach Eric Tinkler had also earlier taken a swipe at Mosimane, saying his counterpart "talks too much". City, who lost 4-2 against SuperSport United on Tuesday, are shoo-in for CAF Confederation Cup qualification and Comitis is upbeat about the prospect of his club competing in Africa next year.
