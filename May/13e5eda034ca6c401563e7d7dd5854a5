 As they prepare to meet tomorrow in arguably the game of the season for either club, they only have themselves to blame for being in the situation they are in.Baroka, who host the relegation six-pointer at Peter Mokaba Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm), were a bit more patient with their coach Kgoloko Thobejane, unlike Highlands Park who got rid of Allan Freese just five games into the season.Thobejane was given almost half of the season before changes were made.It was not a bad idea to bring in someone with fresh ideas almost halfway through the season, but they brought in the wrong man in Jacob Sakala.Sakala had not worked as a coach in the top flight for a few seasons, so he looked to be out of touch with the latest coaching trends.Milton Dlamini had to pick up the pieces and he's done pretty well to keep them alive in the race for survival. Dlamini will need to inspire his charges to a big performance against their fellow strugglers.Baroka have performed well against the big guns but could not repeat those performances against the so-called smaller teams.Highlands will have more confidence going into the game tomorrow after their 1-0 victory over Chippa United on Friday saw them moving off last place in the league standings.Key men in the relegation battleBaroka:Jose GarciaHe's constantly looking for the ball and looking to create opportunities for his teammates.Mzwanele Mahashe:He may be part of the defence that has conceded 43 goals, but he's proven to be effective at the opposite end of the pitch, with six goals in all competitions.Highlands ParkCollins MbesumaAfter a difficult season with injury, the Zambian striker wants to make up for lost time and help Highlands survive. At his best, the Zambian marksman is a potential match winner.Eddie NgaloThe clean sheet Highlands kept on Friday will inspire him and the rest of the guys at the back to keep it tight again.PermutationsIf Baroka win, they will still need to win their final match at Ajax Cape Town to give themselves a chance of surviving automatic relegation.If Highlands win, then they cannot get relegated automatically but they could get sucked into the playoffs on the final day.If Baroka and Highlands draw, both teams still have a chance of being automatically relegated on the last day, although results elsewhere could go their way.Bloemfontein Celtic, Free State Stars and Chippa United also face the prospect of automatic relegation or playoffs.
