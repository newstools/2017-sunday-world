 Last season he was part of the Moroka Swallows side that was relegated from the National First Division, but he got the chance to return to the top flight when Baroka acquired his services.A debut season in the premier division has not gone so well for Baroka and Kunene finds himself in the same situation he was in with Dube Birds.With four matches to play, Baroka are second from bottom, and next on their Absa Premiership schedule is second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns at Lucas Moripe Stadium today (7.30pm).While many may write Baroka off from causing an upset, they have shown that they can be a problem for big sides this season."We can get something [out of the game] if we work as a team. When we play against big teams, we double our efforts. If we do the same against other teams, then we wouldn't be in this situation," said Kunene, whose solo goal against Kaizer Chiefs in March won him the Goal of the Month award."Sundowns are strong going forward, but they are not too strong at the back. We can penetrate them because we have players who have energy."I have been in this [relegation] situation at Swallows, so I know how it feels and I am trying to motivate our players to be strong and focused all the time. I am 100% sure we will avoid relegation."Sundowns midfielder Themba Zwane stressed the importance of taking their chances to avoid dropping points like they did in their 2-2 draw at home to Platinum Stars last week."Baroka is a team that will come at us, so we need to make sure we control the game and take the chances we create and win the game."
