 While there have been improvements from Steve Komphela's first campaign last term, Amakhosi have again not been good enough and their chances of winning the league are surely out of the window now.The 2-2 draw with SuperSport was the second time they had conceded a late goal in as many matches after they were defeated by an injury-time Judas Moseamedi header in the 3-2 defeat to Cape Town City last week.Fourth-placed Amakhosi faces the possibility of finishing another campaign without a trophy, according to football analyst Farouk Khan. Of the clubs currently in the top four, Chiefs have scored the least goals (37).In the matches where Chiefs have dropped points, they took the lead six times and ended up either drawing or losing those games."It has been an inconsistent season for Chiefs. They did not win a trophy last season and it looks like they won't win anything this season. They've had 10 draws this season; that's 20 points dropped," Khan pointed out."To win the league you need about 60 points and you are not going to be in the target range if you get that many draws. If you turn maybe four of those draws into wins maybe they would be at the top."Experienced campaigners Siphiwe Tshabalala and Itumeleng Khune have played a big part in keeping Amakhosi's slim title chances alive, but they are not getting enough support from teammates.
