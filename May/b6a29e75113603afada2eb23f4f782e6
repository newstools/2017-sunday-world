 Gwala, 31, who is known for her Nonny character on SABC2 soapie Muvhango, recently ventured into a car washing and shisa nyama business.The new establishment, called Lotha's Car Wash, is situated in Wynberg, Johannesburg north.While the customers' vehicles are being washed, they have an option of getting themselves mouth-watering food prepared by the actress herself."I have always wanted to have a business in the food and hospitality industry because I love cooking," she said.She told Sunday World that the car-washing business that she co-owns with her Congolese model boyfriend Armando Ngandu was their second idea. "While searching for spaces where we could open a restaurant, we found that places were very expensive. When we finally found this place we decided to do both cooking and car wash."She said Ngandu manages the car wash while she is hands-on on the food side.Ngandu said they plan to grow the business by making theirs stand out from all similar businesses in Joburg.He said they want to turn the place into a family friendly environment where everybody would be welcome."We want to install wi-fi and have a children's play area for parents who want to bring their kids when they come to get their cars washed," he said.He said they have more business ideas that they will be implementing soon.The two met last year, but say they have not started talking about big plans yet.Ngandu said Gwala was rude to him when they first met."I hunted down her numbers and sent her a message a week later," he said.Gwala said after reading the message she ignored it, but changed her mind after she saw his six-pack.She said she later discovered there was more to him than his six-pack."He is very romantic. Little things such as picking me up and bringing me flowers attracted me more to him. " khalianyanel@sundayworld.co.za
