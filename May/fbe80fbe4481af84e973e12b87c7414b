 Mzimela, who plays Kentucky on Isibaya, said she did so badly at her travel management studies at the University of Johannesburg in 2008 that her father sat her down to try to figure out what went wrong."That year was very rough for me. I was trying to familiarised myself with Joburg and amid that my mother passed away," she said.She said she told her father she wanted to study at AFDA - a film, television, performance, business innovation and computer technology school."My father said he didn't think I was ready and that I have to prove to him that the same will not happen," she said.Mzimela, 27, said she then went to Durban University of Technology in 2009 and studied drama for three years."My father was then convinced that I was ready and then I went to AFDA in 2012 where I studied television production for another three years," she said.She told Sunday World that she insisted on going to AFDA because she liked it and her father was giving her that opportunity.A week before her graduation in 2015, she auditioned and got the part of Kentucky, she said."Kentucky is the queen's maid, she is bubbly and sweet. she is never in a bad mood."Mzimela said her character is totally different from her personally because she has her moments.Her future plans include getting into radio."I love radio and one day I would love to work for Metro FM," she said.Mzimela, who was born and bred in Eshowe, KwaZulu-Natal, said she has always known that she wanted to be in the performing arts.She said she looks up to Viola Davis and DJ Zinhle because "I gravitate towards people who have been through a lot but still are living the life."
