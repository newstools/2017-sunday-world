 As Amajita head into their World Cup match in South Korea against Japan on Sunday, Mukumela, 19, is one of those players who know what to expect having played at the same competition at under-17 level in 2015. Amajita are in Group D with Japan, Uruguay and Italy."Playing at my second World Cup shows that I am growing as a player. It will give me good experience," said the Mamelodi Sundowns defender."We know what to expect. Some of us in this camp have been to the World Cup before [in Chile]. The teams are more technical and more tactical. It's not like in Africa, where it's more about physique."Amajita need to finish in one of the top two spots to reach the knockout phase, but they can also qualify as one of the four third best-placed teams to advance.With Percy Tau and Motjeka Madisha playing regularly for Sundowns, Mukumela is hoping that he gets a chance to play in the first team at club level if he does well at the World Cup.
