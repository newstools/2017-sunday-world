 Likewise, as a buyer, you may think that you have no recourse if you agree to the voetstoots clause and discover latent defects after the sale has gone through. Both scenarios are wrong."Voetstoots merely means that as a seller, you are selling the property with the existing problems, so the buyer takes it 'as is'. There is one very important caveat here - as seller, you still have to fully disclose all known problems with the property for the buyer to make an informed decision."A voetstoots clause will not provide any legal protection if you intentionally conceal defects in bad faith and with the purpose of defrauding the buyer," explains Lee-Ann Dobrescu, the head of group business development at Hollard and co-creator of Hollard's Home Warranty.Since the introduction of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), the voetstoots clause has become redundant as the CPA requires sellers and purchasers to be fair and equitable in their contractual interaction.How can you protect yourself?For the seller, there's always the pressure of the defects disclosure list and hoping that you have remembered everything.For buyers there is always the point where post-offer anxiety sets in and you worry about what will happen if something does go wrong and you can't afford to fix it."All of this worry and hassle can be easily done away with by taking out a home warranty. A warranty addresses the issues around defects with a professional property inspection that is coupled to an insurance policy," says Dobrescu.The cost of the home warranty is covered by the seller - all you have to do is specify it in your offer to purchase and the premium can be paid from the proceeds of the sale, much like the estate agent's commission.Premiums are determined on an individual basis, but typically you can expect to pay about R12000 for a warranty on a R1-million home, R17400 for a R2-million home and R27500 for a R5-million home.Contact Hollard directly at hollardhome warranty@hollard.co.za
