 Pulane gave a blow-by-blow account of how two men followed her from shop to shop and even offered her a massive overseas business deal . I had these two foreign guys following me around at Eastgate mall so at first I didn t think it was a big deal until I noticed that they were following me to every store that I went to and they didn t buy anything she said.Pulane added that eventually one of the men approached her and asked for her name.Pulane said the guys continued to follow her and offered her a deal to make millions in Angola.Pulane explained that it became clear that the men were trying to get her to their car or the parking lot and she then called security. He was insisting that he wanted to give me the dollars which were in his car. At this point it was clear that these men were trying by every means to get me in their car or the parking area then I called security on them then they started running she said.Pulane added that she was grateful that she escaped unharmed from the ordeal.
