 After being held to 2-2 draws by Baroka and Platinum Stars at Lucas Moripe Stadium in the last two weeks, Sundowns need to show why they are champions, both on home soil and the continent by overcoming a Maritzburg United side that has improved immensely under the tutelage of caretaker coach Fadlu Davids.Having had a long season playing domestically and on the continent, Sundowns' players look like they are desperate for a much-needed holiday.But there's no chance of that happening any time soon, so they somehow have to find the energy that was lacking in their CAF Champions League goalless draw against Ethiopian side St George at the weekend."It's a must win," said Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane, whose men are two points behind leaders Wits with two games to go.Leaders Wits, meanwhile, take on Polokwane City at Milpark tomorrow (7.30pm). Like Maritzburg, City can have a big say in the title race. City need a win to guarantee their spot in the top eight.Title PermutationsIf Sundowns lose and Wits win, that's it, Wits are champions.If Sundowns win and Wits lose, Sundowns will be top of the table going into the last day of the season.If both return similar results (win, draw or lose), the title will be decided on the final day.
