 This isn t the first time the Gigabas have had to attempt to stand tall during a tornado of criticism after details of the alleged affair between Malusi and a woman who goes by the name of Buhle Mkhize were leaked.It s also not the first time Buhle and Norma have publicly sparred.In 2015 Malusi eventually had to issue a public statement denying the affair and Norma said she would stand by her man.Private messages between Buhle and Norma were then leaked giving us normal folk a look inside the bitter war of words between them.But as usual the Gigabas are presenting a united front.They re both in Cape Town and sat down for a spot of sushi at the trendy Balducci restaurant.The Gigabas are presenting a united front after receiving massive backlash after Norma Gigaba s controversial interview aired on eNCA earlier this week.Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba s alleged affair with Buhle Mkhize was again brought into the spotlight after Norma said she doubted the intentions of Buhle when she first decided to speak about the so-called incident back in 2015.As the couple face mounting pressure Norma took the time to create a collage and spoke about strenght."When storms come don't be shaken or moved, stand still and fix your eyes to the one who created you and placed you where you are. Above all, rise again, fix your crown and wait in the Lord. He will come in the morning and give you new strength," Norma wrote on instagram.
