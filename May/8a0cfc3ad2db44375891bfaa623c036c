 Maseko - whose picture of him lying on the floor in blood did the rounds on social media - suffered a cracked skull and broken ribs after his beloved Sundowns beat Pirates 2-0 at Orlando Stadium on Sunday.He was taken to Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto on Sunday. He was discharged yesterday after he was visited by Downs' players Denis Onyango and Tiyani Mabunda.This attack comes just three months after Bucs fans vandalised and invaded Loftus Stadium during their side's 6-0 defeat by the Brazilians.No punishment has been handed to Pirates or Sundowns for the behaviour of their fans to date, although both teams have been charged.The situation is getting out of hand and Maseko is worried that people will lose their lives."I love football with all my heart. I attend most games and will be going back. The game was nice until the time I was attacked. Why do they have to do that?" Maseko asked yesterday, while he was being driven home to Atteridgeville."We were singing in the passage after we won. We met them [Pirates fans]. They tore our supporters branch material and I was kicked. I saw myself on social media. How must I feel?"PSL spokesperson Lux September said: "I don't want to speak speculatively. But if there was a crime, then the police should act and investigate. We as the PSL will look at the match commissioner's report and take it from there."
