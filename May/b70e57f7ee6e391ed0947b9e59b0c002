 An emotional Baloyi, 30, said: "How am I going to live with this? How will I be able to box again? I went in there just to box. The message of his death killed me inside. I want to quit and I even told my mother about this."Nkabiti, 36, collapsed at the end of round six and was rushed to hospital where a scan detected a blood clot on his brain."His family must forgive me although I did not intend to kill him. I am very sorry," added Baloyi.He finds himself in a similar situation to that of Lizbeth Butler, who wanted to quit after the death of her opponent Phindile Mwelase in October 2014.Butler knocked Mwelase out in the fifth round of their bout in Pretoria. Mwelase underwent surgery to stem bleeding on the brain but she died 10 days later after being taken off life support and and.Butler received counselling and it gave her strength to continue but she fought only once more, defeating Mapula Ngubane in June last year.In 1985, Jacob Morake died of head injuries a day after he was admitted to hospital following his 12th-round stoppage loss to SA junior lightweight champion Brian Mitchell at Sun City.
