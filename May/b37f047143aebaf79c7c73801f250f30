 His decision came two days after Boxing SA (BSA) advised the Johannesburg-based boxer from Limpopo to defend within 30 days or face being stripped. Machimana, 38, had not made even a single defence since winning the title with a fourth-round knockout of Anton "Rolling Thunder" Nel on May 28 last year."I could not get challenges. When I received a letter from BSA, I decided to vacate it rather than be stripped," Machimana told Sowetan yesterday."When I won this title, I was filled with joy and I hoped to make some money."But I did not enjoy the prestige of being a national champion at all because I did not get to defend."Machimana, who turned professional in 2000, said he would continue fighting.His friend and sparring partner Ruann "Giant King" Visser, the recently crowned African Boxing Union South champion, is the No 1 contender for the SA title.Two weeks ago, Machimana was in action in Brakpan, where he stopped Sithembele August in three rounds of their six-rounder.Meanwhile, Ryno "The Lion" Liebenberg was also instructed to defend his light heavyweight strap within 30 days or forfeit.
