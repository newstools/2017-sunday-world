 An employee at Mooifontein Cemetery in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, who asked not to be named for fear of losing his job, said more than 50 memorials were vandalised by nyaope users to steal the ashes.He said the theft has been going on for some time and it was difficult to keep out the thugs who gain access to the graveyard through holes in the fence where people went in and out as they pleased."Nyaope addicts vandalise these things because they smoke the ashes.
