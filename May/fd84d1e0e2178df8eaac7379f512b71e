 Speaking to TshisaLIVE Jesse said that even though he s out of competition he learnt many invaluable lessons which he will use in his career.When Jesse first entered the competition he had many detractors because he burst onto the entertainment scene as an actor but he believed in his talent.Jesse s fast flow and punchlines kept him in the competition week after week till he made it to top 7 where he was booted off. I had three things that I set to do when I entered this competition. One was to win obviously but more than that I wanted to prove to people that I can rap and to build a fan-base for when I release my own music he said.The aspiring rapper said the show gave him a glimpse of SA s rap industry. I learned so much about the music industry and I also realised that there are so many of us trying to break into the industry. We are all so different and that means we all actually have a chance it s just a matter of knowing how to apply your uniqueness he said. Pretty Boy as he was called in the competition said he expected Flex Rabanyane (a firm favourite) Dee Exclusive and Joshua The I am to make it to the top three.Jesse who is also a presenter on BET s A-list told TshisaLIVE that he is definitely dropping a rap project this year and he is confident people will love what he has to offer.Even though Jesse got booted off the show fans loved his bars.
