 The Brazilians lost their title to the Clever Boys in midweek and Zwane admitted to the Sowetan that he's gutted."Personally, I feel bad and I'm sure it is the same thing with my teammates. Our mission was to defend our title, but things didn't go our way," he admitted. "But we can't look down forever.""Mshishi" conceded that the better team won this season."Wits have done well for themselves and I want to congratulate them. They really worked hard and gave us a tough time," said Zwane, referring to Sundowns' recent 1-0 loss to Wits, who also beat the Brazilians in the MTN8 final.As much as Sundowns are the top scoring side in the league with 50 goals, the 27-year-old believes they could have done better in attack."We created chances in most games but we didn't take them whereas our opponents would create two and take them, then we lost points," he continued."We will bounce back for sure," said the Tembisa-born midfielder, who has eight goals this season.It's not all doom and gloom for Zwane, though, after he was awarded a car sponsorship at Baron's VW in Woodmead, Johannesburg yesterday.Zwane will serve as the dealership's official ambassador for the next two years with an option to renew. He will cruise around in a red VW Golf GTi."We monitored his performance and followed his social life. Mshishi is a reserved gentleman who does his job very well on the field and we believe he will represent our dealership well in the footballing market," said the dealership's principal, Gawie Stoltz.
