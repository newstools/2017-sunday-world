 Chiefs are finishing a second season under Komphela without a trophy, prompting some of their fans to call for his removal as head coach before he enters the final year of his three-year contract.But like owner Kaizer Motaung, the Chiefs team manager reiterated this week that the club would not dispense with Komphela yet, reasoning he had shown signs he was getting it right after taking the job in 2015."You don't change coaches like that," Motaung told Sowetan this week. "How many years did it take for Gavin Hunt to be fighting to win the league [with Bidvest Wits]? It's the same story with Pitso [Mosimane]. He got there [at Mamelodi Sundowns] when they were buying everyone. But he changed that. Chiefs took 47 years to be where it is today. It has never been about overnight success - we don't want that."Chiefs' technical team will spend the next week taking stock of the season, with Komphela expected to report back to management, and point out areas that require strengthening."We will be having workshops next week to review the season. But the idea that we can dispose of a coach after he has worked hard to build a team over two years doesn't apply to us. Imagine we fire him now and another coach comes in to ride on his hard work? The truth is Steve has been a bit unfortunate. We have played well this season. How do you blame him for the last-minute goals we conceded in the latter part of the title race?" Motaung said.He also lauded Komphela for giving youngsters like Lorenzo Gordinho and Ryan Moon a chance this season."Steve has been brave enough to change the team and promote players who were not given a chance before. But sometimes our fans are not patient. They want results now."Chiefs, who lost to Platinum Stars on Wednesday and are fifth in the Premiership standings, conclude their season with a home clash against new league champions Wits next weekend.
