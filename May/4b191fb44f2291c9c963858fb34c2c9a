 In April last year, former sports minister Fikile Mbalula banned Athletics SA (ASA), CSA, NSA and Saru from bidding for and hosting major international events in the country due to their failure to meet their transformation targets.Nxesi lifted the ban on three of the four federations when presenting the latest EPG Transformation Status Report at Loftus Versfeld stadium."It comes from the barometer, the targets that they have set for themselves with the previous leadership in the ministry," Nxesi said."It becomes very clear that in terms of their efforts to meet the targets they have gone beyond 50%. We are saying, therefore, that they have the right to bid and host international tournaments."Nxesi warned that that federations may lose the right to bid and host if they regress on transformation policies.The minister was also not impressed with ASA."If we look more closely at the data on athletics contained in the EPG report, we see that the problem is that you simply didn't provide data against a number of categories."This points to a lack of systems and poor structures and governance in the code and my department will work with you to address these challenges."Of particular concern is the paucity of data in relation to club and school athletics, the very bedrock of our sport system... I am therefore issuing a directive to ASA to directly exercise control over the South African Schools Athletics Association." - TMG Digital
