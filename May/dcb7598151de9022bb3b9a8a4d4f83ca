 Hunt's four-year deal with the Clever Boys expires at the end of next month but, after helping them to two trophies this season, he's sure to bargain for a better deal.Bidvest chairman Joffe, speaking in the aftermath of last Wednesday's title triumph, responded with a firm "yes" when asked if Hunt would continue in the job."He's staying because he's got a contract with us. If he goes away, I will fetch him," Joffe said.Joffe was thrilled for Wits to celebrate a first title in nearly a century of the club's existence, pointing out Bidvest had come a long way after first investing in the club over a decade ago."We are proud of the players to achieve this. It's a great moment - a first [title] in over 90 years. Immediately after we got involved, we were relegated [in 2005], but we bounced back strongly the following year."From the time Gavin got involved with us the team has been building and it cost us money but there has been progress. We should have won it [the title] the season before but we were unlucky."Hunt gave a strong hint that the title triumph gave him a strong base to enter fresh contract negotiations."This is a good time to talk about a contract isn't it? Get the board members some whiskey after winning the title and we can talk," the Wits coach joked.Wits conclude the season with a visit to Kaizer Chiefs this Saturday (FNB Stadium, 3pm), where they will officially be crowned as champions, receiving medals, a trophy and a R10-million cheque.
