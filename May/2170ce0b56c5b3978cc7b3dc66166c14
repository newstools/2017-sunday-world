 Babes unfortunately didn't take home any gongs, which is a repeat of what happened at the Metro FM Music Awards earlier this year.Even though the gqom queen ended the show with an explosive performance, she promised that she will boycott awards if she went home with nothing.During a red carpet interview on Saturday night Babes reiterated her statements. Mampintsha uploaded an expletive ridden video on twitter to express his frustrations. "F***k all this sh**t F**k! you're jealous, you're all jealous. How can a song trend the whole year, little kids were singing the song, even little white kids! Then you as a board decide that this is the song that won and Babes doesn't win. Babes always doesn't win because you guys are jealous, you're jealous." A visibly upset Mampintsha charges.Watch the video hereBabes also took to social media to speak her mind.Babes went on to say that it was 'clear that awards are bought here in South Africa'. The singer however let it be known that despite her lack of awards she's still booking gigs."I was even nominated for the BET's overseas but I don't get even one award at home? There is no such thing, please don't play with us. Continue to buy your awards. Continue and feel free, because we're not going to go hungry, we're getting booked. I will always be Babes and Mampintshawill always be Mampintsha and West Ink will always be West Ink. Thank you" Watch the emotionally charged video below: @TheSAMAs #SAMA23 pic.twitter.com/Ek3FYQe5xx
