 The incident happened on Saturday last week before the league match between Kaizer Chiefs and Lamontville Golden Arrows.Nkosinathi Mthiyane, an Orlando Pirates player who is on loan to Arrows, found police and his baby mama camping at the stadium's dressing room with a summons and a maintenance order.This was allegedly because Mthiyane, 28, had failed to support his child since his move to Arrows in January.His baby mama, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child, was left with no choice but to approach the Johannesburg Family Court.Police spokeswoman Lorraine van Emmerik confirmed her colleagues waylaid Mthiyane at the stadium and served him with court papers."This was due to the fact that numerous attempts were made to serve him with the papers at two of his known addresses, but were unsuccessful."Information was received that he would be at the stadium and, therefore, the papers were served at the stadium," said Van Emmerik.She said after the player acknowledged receipt of the summons, the papers were handed back to the lady to take to court as per the order.However, it is understood that the legal process was marred by drama as Mthiyane's colleagues and a team official were against the presence of the police in their change room.Van Emmerik said she was not aware about the drama because "the station has received no complaint so far".Arrows CEO Gordon Masondo, who is said to have accepted the documents on behalf of Mthiyane, questioned "why didn't the police go to his home address in Robertsham?".Masondo said he accepted the documents on behalf of Mthiyane and said the matter was attended to. Mthiyane refused to comment.
