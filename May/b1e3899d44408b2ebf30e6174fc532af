 Muntari was sent off last week for leaving the field after claiming he was racially abused during a Serie A game against Cagliari.The 32-year-old, who was initially booked for dissent, had his suspension overturned, but the former Inter Milan star believes racism is everywhere and getting worse and he is determined to take a stand. I went through hell and was treated like a criminal, he told BBC Sport on Monday. I went off the field because it wasn t right for me to be on the field while I have been racially abused. If I had this problem today, tomorrow or the next game I would go off again. Muntari called on FIFA president Gianni Infantino to do more to clampdown on the evil of racism in football. I think he is capable of doing something in a good way to fight racism. I want him to fight racism, he said. I never heard anything like that in England because I think they don t tolerate it. England is the example for the world. If a country doesn t tolerate it then it means you get rid of it.
