 Baxter, who will announce his first Bafana squad in nine days, has signed a five-year contract which will be reviewed along the way, depending on the team's milestones.Baxter will coach SuperSport if they reach the Nedbank Cup final on June 24, but he will not work for the club during their CAF Confederation Cup campaign.His first task is to face Nigeria in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Uyo next month. He has already started planning for that game. The last time he was in charge - between 2004 and 2005 - Baxter was unable to qualify for the 2006 World Cup in Germany."When I first came to SA, I knew little about life in South Africa. I tried to prepare myself by reading and talking to people at the embassy. I remember there was huge element of negativity. I came back to Chiefs and there was the same negativity. I gained some respect by the results at Chiefs and SuperSport," said Baxter yesterday."I believe that the nation has enough good players. I believe in my own ability. I have won trophies at virtually every club I have worked for."He added: "Yes, I want to qualify for big tournaments, but on a long-term basis I want to see the country united behind a strategy and a vision."Baxter did not want to go into his selection criteria. This was a huge issue with former coach Shakes Mashaba, who at times picked players who were not active at club level."The criteria of selection is important. You need to know the player, you need to know his attitude. I want players who are good South Africans."
