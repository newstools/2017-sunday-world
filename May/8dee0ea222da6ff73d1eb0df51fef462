 The age when girls get their first period varies. However, younger than 12 years is generally considered to be "early".Early period and diabetes?The possibility that a first period before the age of 12 is linked with pregnancy health was explored in our recent study. We found that girls who had early first periods were more likely to develop diabetes when they later became pregnant as an adult.Gestational diabetes is a serious pregnancy complication, as it increases the risk of pre-term labour and giving birth to a large baby.It is also considered a "stress test" for the later development of type 2 diabetes for both the mother and child in affected pregnancies.Is the age at first period changing?The age of first menstruation has decreased in most Western countries, from an average of 17 more than a century ago, to around 13 today.We know circumstances in early life - parental divorce and abuse, as well as childhood obesity - can trigger early reproductive development. Environmental changes - such as the use of hair products, plastic water bottles and food packaging - have also been examined as a possible cause of early age first period.What does this mean for women's health?Girls with an early first period are at greater risk of depression and anxiety, and display higher rates of risky behaviours such as smoking, drinking, illicit drug use and unprotected sex.What can we do?Supporting healthy environments and behaviours from early in life are important strategies.Schoenaker is a professor at The University of Queensland, Australia.
