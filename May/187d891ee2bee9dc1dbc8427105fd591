We have apologised to each other. There was a lot of wrongness he knows it and I know it. We ve sat down and we spoke about it.

She also admitted to accepting a lot of responsibility for the wrongness between them. I have had to take a lot of responsibility because a lot of what happened was me just not giving him the chance to be. I had to dig deep and introspect and everything that happened allowed me to do that she said.Thembisa also revealed that some of the challenges they faced as a couple stemmed from her not fully trusting the moments she had.There was also a time when she was incredibly frustrated and felt useless because she was not getting gigs and he was.

He d go to work and he would come back and I d still be wearing the same gown I was wearing in the morning she said.Thembisa revealed that she and Atandwa weren t in combat mode anymore and after a journey of self-realisation she is standing tall. Now I am more of a giving and open person I do not care what people say and what happens on the outside. I can truly say I am free she said.And judging by the bling on her finger it seems like Thembisa has also found love again.Even though she could not hide the rock on her finger Thembisa avoided confirming if she is engaged or not.
