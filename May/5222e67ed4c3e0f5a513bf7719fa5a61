 Sundowns had it in their hands but let it slip at home for a second consecutive game, drawing 2-2 with the relegation threatened Limpopo outfit.Sundowns uncharacteristically squandered their two-goal lead, allowing Baroka to put them under pressure in the second period.This was a big chance missed for Sundowns as leaders Bidvest Wits were beaten 3-1 by Free State Stars in Bethlehem last night.Sundowns, who are two points behind the Clever Boys, will still believe they can defend their title but it won't happen if they drop points at this stage of the season. In their last four games, Sundowns have dropped seven points, which is not good enough.For Baroka, this was a huge result. They fought to the end and always believed they could get something out of the game.After Sundowns scored through Khama Billiat and an own goal by Baroka defender Mzwanele Mahashe, the visitors pulled one back in first half stoppage.Mahashe redeemed himself by scoring a headed goal from a corner kick. This gave them some hope of coming back in the second period.When the fourth official lifted his board to signal six minutes of added time, Baroka went on an all out attack.The visitors were up on their feet when they were awarded a penalty for a Thapelo Morena hand ball in the box and substitute Richard Matloga converted to make the score 2-2.It will be an interesting finish to the title. It won't be any different in the race to stay alive. Top-placed Wits next play Polokwane City next Wednesday while Sundowns take on Maritzburg United.
