 Madikizela is expanding to the mining town of Carletonville, on the West Rand after her Mohlakeng, Randfontein-based AmaX-rays radiography company won the grand prize of R500000 at the Gauteng Awards last month.The grand prize the AmaX-rays founder and owner received was over and above the R200000 the company won in the health services sector category of the awards - an initiative of the Gauteng government. Madikizela says she got the motivation to study radiography after matriculating in 2004 when her grandmother was suffering from knee ligament and bone ailments."I started wondering what was bothering my granny. I became curious and wanted to learn about bones and joints, as well as the related sicknesses."Madikizela, 30, did her practical training at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, a hospital she chose because "it's the biggest in Africa".As is the case with many entrepreneurs, in 2014 she struggled to secure funding to purchase radiography machines and equipment. She then went to Google search, desperate for a second-hand machine. Fortunately, she found one on sale but lacked the cash up- front payment. She decided to rent the equipment with the intention to purchase it."I could not resist taking the business a notch up after I identified a gap at the mines, that's why I will be opening another practice in Carletonville.She employs four people - two nursing assistants and two office administration staff.
