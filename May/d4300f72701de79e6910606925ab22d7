 Businesses are no longer competing during business hours, but 24/7 as consumers demand convenience.Jeremy Lang, regional general manager at Business Partners, says that this has presented both opportunities and challenges for local small and medium enterprises (SMEs)."Increasingly businesses are having to compete for a continually decreasing slice of the pie as economic conditions remain under pressure. Thereby SMEs must take heed of rising trends that can retain and attract customers, such as maximising their online presence to adapt to the new world of how customers engage with brands and businesses."Lang points to the recently released 2017 Global Online Consumer Report by KPMG International, which cites that 64% of South Africans stated that being able to easily contact a company was a top trust factor for them.Furthermore, 65% of all respondents said that excellent customer support was the number one loyalty-earning attribute.In terms of social media presence, Lang says that this can't be underestimated, or ignored, in a business' marketing strategy.Lang points to a global study by Conversocial, which revealed that customer-service interactions over Twitter increased by 250% since 2015 and that answering a social media complaint increases customer advocacy by 25%.He says businesses shouldn't just be present for the sake of having an online platform though, but rather to use these platforms to seek meaningful relationships with clients and to improve how their products are accessed or experienced.A customer service report by Forrester Research revealed that 72% of people say that the most pivotal thing a company can do in terms of customer service is to value their time."Customer service is also evolving from merely providing solutions to delving further into customer engagement territory," said Lang. - Business Partners Limited
