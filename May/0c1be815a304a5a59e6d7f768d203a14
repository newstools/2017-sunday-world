 Although the Flames beat Limpopo Baobabs 49-28 at the weekend, it was only superior fitness and experience that pulled them through at the Bellville Velodrome on Friday."A few players are still struggling to get into game form, but I was pleasantly surprised by some of the new combinations that I tried. The team battled to keep position and made elementary mistakes."We will only get better because it is not like we lost the match," Badenhorst said after their hard-fought win.At the start of the Premier League season, it was thought that the Flames would have a bad season, especially after two of their key players were lured by Gauteng teams. However, the North West outfit have defied the odds. They have won six of their last seven matches. Their solitary defeat came last month, a 44-48 loss to Gauteng Golden Fireballs.This weekend's fixtures will be hosted at Mangaung Sports Complex in Bloemfontein from Friday until Sunday.
