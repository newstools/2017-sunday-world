 The club's head coach Pitso Mosimane, however, is not worried and has suggested that players should not even contemplate leaving the Brazilians, if they are ambitious enough."We look after our players. I think you know what happens to the prizemoney when we win any cup. So do you really want that? You know how many trophies we won last year? The president [Patrice Motsepe] gave us all the money," Mosimane said.To their credit, the Tshwane side have already tied down Dennis Onyango (four years), Wayne Arendse (undisclosed) and Anthony Laffor (two years) to new deals.However, there are a host of players who are still waiting to sign new deals and clubs such as SuperSport United and Bidvest Wits are famous for pouncing on players who are out of contract. So Sundowns should be careful.Kekana, 31, is apparently on the wanted list of Wits, SuperSport and Kaizer Chiefs."All I know is that we are talking to everyone and we are not relaxed in the negotiations."You have to understand that we've had back-to-back games, so we don't want to stress players with contract issues."But I can tell you we are in a serious relationship with our players," said Sundowns spokesman Thulani Thuswa.
