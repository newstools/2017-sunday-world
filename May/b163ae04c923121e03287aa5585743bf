I don't like a muscular man. A man should look like he works for his familySunday World quizzed female celebrities about their preferences when it comes to men: would they go for a man with a pot-belly or a muscular one.Some of Mzansi's favourite female celebrities believe a man should "look like a man".Radio queen Lerato Kganyago said she prefers a man who looks like he takes care of his family."I'm not moved by muscles. In fact, those are the kinds of men I stay away from."I don't like muscular men. A man should look like he works to take care of his family. I don't like a man who looks like he spends 90% of his time at the gym," she says.However, the radio DJ made it clear that she does not want a man with a mkhaba (pot-belly)."He has to be medium," she added.Bonang Matheba, popularly known as "Queen B' said a belly is not bad on a man."In African culture, a man with a (mkhaba) belly is generally known as a man with money," she chuckled."But honestly, I don't look at those features in men. I want a man with ambition, who works hard."Matheba says she is lucky to have a man who works out. "My babe works out. That also inspires me to live a healthy life, but that is not strictly what I'm looking for in a man. Working out is a plus."But some women celebrities like television presenter, Boity Thulo, prefers a "lean man"."I prefer a healthy man and by healthy I mean he has to look toned and lean. Not that I prefer a man with too much muscle but he must be lean," said Thulo.Skeem Saam actress, Amanda Du-Pont, said she had long passed the stage of judging men by their stomachs."A relationship is about what is inside and the honesty in that person," Du-Pont said."I'm more concerned about personality and the relationship rather than what his stomach looks like," she added.Actress and radio DJ Thando Thabethe says she does not have a problem with a mkhaba, "as long as it is not too big"."Honestly, I do not care too much about that," said Thabethe.
