 Dr Malinga is in the business of making people dance but his entrepreneurial spirit is far more ambitious.The musician is successfully running Lingas Entertainment and a vehicle tracking company called in addition to making hit songs. I wasn t always a businessman although I ve always been hustler. But once I realised that passion is the main ingredient for making money nothing could stop me he said.The musician explained that although Lingas was a natural field to go into his tracking company was birthed through unfortunate circumstaces. I was once hijacked at gun point. The memories are still so fresh. But after the initial shock wore off the idea to start the car tracking company came to me and even though I struggled at first it finally took off he said.Malinga said that the business is doing well and it has taught him discipline and how to use his boldness to get more customers. He said that he had a lot of critics but he went on to educate himself because he was fuelled by passion. I still remember how I felt after they took my car. It was a Venture but for people like us any kind of car is a dream come true and sometimes a life long dream. That s why I went into business he said.The Akulaleki hitmaker believes that part of the reason his businesses are doing well is because he is not arrogant and he is willing to learn. He adds that he is not threated by people who are more qualified than him rather he absorbs all he can.
