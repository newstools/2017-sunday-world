 Sowetan raised the first concern on April 22 after Danie van Heerden - a former mixed martial arts SA heavyweight champion - registered more than 124kg for a fight he won on points against Chris Mabombo (102.75kg) in Krugersdorp.On Sunday, Congolese Peto Kapela, who resembled a sumo wrestler, weighed 132.7kg for his professional boxing debut at Presleys in Boksburg.His opponent Greg Oliver tipped the scales at 106.3kg.Kapela struggled for breath from the fourth round. He occasionally stopped fighting and took deep breaths. Kapela lost on all three judges' scorecards.Said Nyingwa: "The least I can do is speak to their trainers and managers and make a plea that their boxers must look the part. But the real unfortunate problem is the heavyweight division has no limit."They don't even remove their clothes during the weigh-in," added Nyingwa, who was tournament supervisor at both events.The minimum weight for a heavyweight division is set at 91.16kg but boxers can be be 200kg. Medical practitioner, Muziwakhe Qobose, said proper physical condition matters the most in sports."If you are over 120kg and unfit as a boxer, then there is real problem because your heart, especially when you are under pressure, can give you serious problems. Look at what happens when an unfit person participates in road running."Some die while others suffer permanent injuries. In boxing it is even worse because blows are exchanged. Chances of life-threatening injuries are galore because you will not be able to defend yourself at that weight."
