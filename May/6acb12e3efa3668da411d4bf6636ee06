 Clubs will be competing to book spots in continental competitions while the battle for top eight spots and survival will keep supporters on the edge of their seats.CAF spotsChampions League champions Mamelodi Sundowns have to win against Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium to secure their spot in the competition.If they lose and Cape Town City beat Polokwane City, then Pitso Mosimane's men will finish third and qualify for the less prestigious Confederation Cup.Top eightTwo spots are up for grabs. Five clubs - Maritzburg United, Ajax Cape Town, Golden Arrows, Platinum Stars and Orlando Pirates - go into the final day with a chance of either falling out of the top eight or making the cut. Wins for Maritzburg and Ajax against Bloemfontein Celtic and Baroka respectively would confirm their spots even if the other three clubs win their matches. Pirates are less fancied to make it as they have to beat Arrows and hope Platinum Stars and Ajax drop points.RelegationAll teams from position 12 to 16 are not safe from relegation. Celtic, in 12th, need just a draw against Maritzburg to survive. Chippa, in 13th, visit 14th placed Free State Stars in Bethlehem and the winner will be safe. A draw could still be enough for both sides to survive, but it depends on how Highlands Park and Baroka do. Mathematically, bottom placed Baroka can survive without having to go to the playoffs. The Limpopo outfit have to beat Ajax in Cape Town and hope Highlands lose to Sundowns and either Chippa or Stars lose.
