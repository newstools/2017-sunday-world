 The little boy is not even a week old yet and he s already riding around dripping in designer gear.Proud papa Kenny shared a picture of himself taking baby Remo out for a walk in his Doona stroller which apparently retails in SA from R6000.Then to make sure little Remo didn t catch a cold in this chilly Joburg weather dad covered him with a gold embellished Versace baby blanket.According to numerous websites the blanket sells from about R3 500.And here the rest of us do bulk buys in town. #lifegoals
