 Siyasanga Mbambani appears to have exchanged suggestive SMSes with former ANC treasurer Mathews Phosa and with Eastern Cape premier Phumulo Masualle, who sent her a plane ticket to fly to East London at one time.Although her exchanges with Phosa and Masualle are not as raunchy as her chats with Radebe, in which he was recorded requesting nude pictures of her, they paint a picture of a shared intimacy.According to sources close to her and the two politicians, Mbambani first sent Phosa an SMS in March last year stating that she had dreamt of him and former president Thabo Mbeki.Mbambani texted Phosa on March 5 last year using his indigenous name: "Morning Nakedi ... how did you sleep? Ndiphuphe ngawe yazi and Mr T Mbeki."TO READ THE FULL STORY GET A COPY OF TODAY'S SUNDAY WORLD AT YOUR NEAREST STORE
