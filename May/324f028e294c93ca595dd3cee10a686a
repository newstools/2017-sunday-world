 The Swede seemed relatively pleased with the goalless draw away at Bloemfontein Celtic on Wednesday that moved the Buccaneers from 10th to ninth place but also marked a three successive game without scoring. We have the ambition to get into the top eight he affirmed with matches to come against Ajax Cape Town who are one place above them on goal difference only in the Premier Soccer League standings and Lamontville Golden Arrows.They also meet Arrows away in Durban next Sunday in the cup semifinal which might be already weighing on the team psyche and proving a distraction.Pirates played out a 14th draw of the league season more than any other side - on a horribly bumpy pitch at the Molemela Stadium on Wednesday night. Maybe our focus is a little on the cup even if we are not talking about it " Jonevret said."But for me the attention is on the next game against Ajax (at home on Wednesday night) and we really have to win our last two league games."The supporters are all talking about the Nedbank Cup."Whenever I m stopped that is what they want to know about."But it is important to try and win our last two games in the league said Jonevret who has now been in charge for 14 matches but failed to make much impact since replacing Augusto Palacios. I think we showed against Celtic that we can do that."I was happy with the way we played because I think we had five to six really good chances but at the end it s all about scoring goals. You could see how important a game it was for Celtic."So they were a tough opponent but overall I think it was a good away game for us the Pirates coach added. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
