 Last night, when they needed to bounce back from Monday's 1-0 defeat to Bidvest Wits, the defending champions were held to a surprise 2-2 draw by a Platinum Stars side desperate to open a gap between themselves and the clubs below them in the relegation zone.Sundowns are barely holding on to the title after dropping points again in a space of four days.What was surprising about this draw is how Sundowns squandered a lead. When they usually take a lead, especially as early as they did here last night, you expect them to go on and finish off the job.But after defender Thabo Nthethe gave them the lead in the sixth minute, Dikwena striker Ndumiso Mabena levelled matters to give the visitors some much-needed confidence.Instead of stamping their authority as hosts, Sundowns were not quite as forceful by their high standards.Percy Tau and Khama Billiat were not combining as well as they usually do, while Anthony Laffor and Yannick Zakri were struggling with their end product.Eight minutes after the halftime break Mabena bagged his brace to give Stars the lead.He beat Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango at the near post, after was sent through from a free kick in Sundowns half, after a foul by captain Hlompho Kekana.Stars were in search for more, and also introduced talisman Robert Nga'ambi in attack. But it was Sundowns who scored, as Ivorian Zakri levelled matter on the hour mark.It was his first this season.Late in the game, Dikwena's Siphamandla Mlilo was sent off for bringing down Zakri.This venue produced a goalless draw the night before in the game between SuperSport United and Bloemfontein Celtic, but last night it came alive with four goals.
