 The Sowetan reported on Tuesday that Peter Zulu died on Monday after a long battle with cancer.His death comes less than a year after he buried his son Peter who died after a trek up Mount Kilimanjaro for charity. The passing of Gugu impacted [on] him badly just when we thought he was getting better said Tseliso Motloheloa a family spokesperson. It is hard because we had the passing of Gugu s cousin from Welkom [Mohau Sekoto] in January. I think at the time when we were dealing with that pain of Mohau three months down the line Gugu s dad passes. It had a cumulative effect on the family it is painful.
