 Luc Eymael's return to Polokwane City at the weekend will no doubt cause tension in the boardroom, with sources at the club revealing that his relationship with chairman Johnny Mogaladi is untenable.It is well known that Eymael was not happy with the interference in his duties at the club, leading to his departure, which did not come without any drama.While he was welcomed by the players, some of the members in management were not as welcoming to the coach, sources at the club said.Contacted by Sowetan yesterday, Eymael did not want to comment on his return to Polokwane or his relationship with Mogaladi."I don't want to comment on this. If you want to see what happens, then come to training and see for yourself. I don't have anything to say," he said.Said Mogaladi: "I have not seen him. I am in Gauteng." He wouldn't comment any further.Eymael left City in March and signed a contract with Bloemfontein Celtic but the Limpopo club blocked the move.The beleaguered coach returned to the club on Friday after the PSL's dispute resolution chamber ordered him to return to City last month. Eymael initially defied the order and was fined R100000 last week by the PSL for rebelling.
