 The politician-cum-businessman filed an application at the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg against Waterberg Coal Company and its subsidiary Firestone Energy Limited on Tuesday.He served as both their board chairman between 2013 and 2015. According to court documents seen by Sunday World, Phosa resigned from the two companies in May last year.Phosa, one of the eight candidates vying for the ANC's top position at the party's upcoming elective conference in December, said both Waterberg and Firestone owed him R2,285-million for unpaid consulting fees, which make up a total of about R4,6-million."The purpose of this application is to place the 1st respondent [Waterberg Coal] and the second respondent [Firestone Energy] into liquidation in order to protect their respective assets for the benefit of the general body of creditors and to prevent the board of directors and the management of 1st respondent and second respondent from disposing [of] any assets for the benefit of one or [a] few of their creditors to the detriment of all the other creditors," read the documents.Phosa also revealed that the two companies have debts totaling more than R1.2-billion.The affidavit also states that before Phosa filed the application to liquidate the two companies, he had successfully sued Waterberg for R1,9-million for unpaid services and consulting fees at the same court.In the papers filed at the time, Phosa told the court that he had entered into an oral agreement with Waterberg chief executive Stephen Miller, in which they agreed that he would be paid a total amount of R215332 per month for work he was to do for the company.Phosa said that he only received one payment totalling R640743 from the entity between December 31 2013 and February 2014.He said despite an agreement on an increase in his monthly fee to R320371, the company only paid him until July 2014 and short paid him an amount of R47268 for the month of August 2014."The defendant also failed to pay the plaintiff the agreed amount of R320371 per month for the period September 2014 to February 2015, totaling an amount of R1,9-million, which amount is due and payable, and which amount notwithstanding demand, the defendant has failed to pay to the plaintiff," reads the documents.But now, Phosa said he was in a process of instructing attorneys in Australia to institute legal action against Waterberg to help him recover R2,3-million in unpaid consulting fees.Phosa also planned to take a similar action against Firestone in the same country for a similar amount of R2,3-million.Complementing his application, Phosa argued that Waterberg had defaulted on its loan obligations to Standard Bank for A$53 million, an equivalent of R557-million in June last year and said the amount remains unpaid to this day.Phosa said in the papers that he was surprised the bank has not taken any legal action against Waterberg to recover monies owed to it, saying it was well aware that the company has no income whatsoever.The former Mpumalanga premier further said Waterberg's shares were suspended and later removed from both the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Australian Stock Exchange for failure to pay their annual listing fees.Phosa said the removal from the stock exchanges was due to the company's failure to pay their auditors."I fear that in the event that the 1st respondent even were to pay my claims against it, such payment to me may well be an undue preferential payment to me to the detriment of the other creditors ...," argued Phosa.One of the supporting documents in the court papers detailed Phosa's expected role in the failed mining project and how he was set to benefit if the project was successful.According to the e-mail, Phosa was expected to bring in funding and investment from South Africa's Public Investment Corporation and to secure coal supplying contracts with Eskom.In return, according to the papers, Phosa was to be granted 10-million extra options on his shares.Phosa was also due to receive another R2.63-million in shares as incentive and motivation when the following milestones were reached:- Successful closing of the initial R210-million capital raise- Closing of the subsequent capital raise of up to R1.58-billion- The draw-on down of the project finance debt- The investment of the PIC- The first coal production; and- The successful agreement on the coal supply to Eskom.Phosa's attorney Wenzel Kerremans of Kerremans Attorneys confirmed an application had been made on the top Mpumalanga politician's behalf. "The matter has not been heard yet and is therefore still sub judice," said Kerremans.
