 The former ANC Youth League secretary-general was gravely wounded in a hit-style attempt on his life in July and died as a result of his wounds last week.Speaking at his funeral on Saturday his uncle Reverend P. Thobela said that his killers may be found within party ranks. We love the comrades [the ANC] but when they do this we are scared he said.Thobela said that the motive for his nephew s murder should be viewed against the national political landscape. Everything points to December [the ANC s national elective conference] he said.Magaqa s friend Les Stuta said that the newly-elected Umzimkhulu Councillor was killed when he was on the cusp of exposing corruption. He came to me with documents on corruption around a community hall. We are here because we lost him over a hall he said.He said that rifts in the local political spectrum had placed Magaqa s life under threat. Municipalities are hiring hitmen now...how many people are going to die Stuta said.
