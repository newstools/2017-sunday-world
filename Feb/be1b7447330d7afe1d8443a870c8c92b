"You cannot sell alcohol on Saturday and condemn it on Sunday"Mokgobi, a former mayor of Mopani District Municipality, now preaches the word of God in the building. He confirmed he had converted the joint, which was a favourite drinking hole for the area's black diamonds, to a temple of God."I can confirm that I'm a pastor and I have converted the liquor restaurant to my church, The Rock of God Ministries."The word of God says alcoholism or drunkenness is a sin, so you cannot sell alcohol to people on Saturday and condemn it on Sunday," he said."I want to live by the word of God and do everything according to the word of God. Besides, the restaurant was next to a high school. So at break school kids would sneak out and go to buy alcohol and that was not good for the education of our kids," he said.Relating how he became a pastor, Mokgobi said he received a phone call from Bishop Rikhotso of PWWCC church when he was in KZN last year."He asked to see me urgently. When I went to see him, he told me that he had had a revelation that God wanted me to be a pastor. He said: 'It's either you do this or you will die or if your are lucky you will be a pastor when confined to a wheelchair.' He told me that I didn't even have to go to school to be a pastor. I should just preach because God will be behind me."And that's how Mokgobi started preaching until today.
