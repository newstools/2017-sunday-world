It s very unfortunate and sad that such crimes occur in our country. We are very happy though that Karma is not injured or harmed in anyway, he said.He said should the Zimbabwean genius need any form of counselling the club will support him.Thuswa also confirmed that the player s wallet and watch were taken. I spoke to him not so long ago and is he also happy to have escaped with his life, said Thuswa.However, Thuswa said the value of the items was still unclear. We will see him tonight at the match (against Chippa United) but he will not be playing because he is injured, he said.Asked what the player was doing at the garage just after midnight, Thuswa said the star player stayed close to where the alleged robbery took place. I asked him and he said he was going put petrol and buy some minor stuff, including prepaid electricity, he said.A security guard who was there when the drama unfolded said the men burst into the garage s food store and demanded that everyone lie on the floor.Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said there were about three customers when incident happened. I didn t see where they came from, I just saw AK-47s pointed at us and I immediately dropped on my stomach to the floor, he said.Midrand police could not be reached for comment.
