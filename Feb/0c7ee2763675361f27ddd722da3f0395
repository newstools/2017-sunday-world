Zita is prepared to do whatever to revive her father's legacyShe's got the looks to make any man weak in the knees, but now her portrayal of the beautiful Zitha is making her fellow actors' hearts melt on the SABC 1 soapie.When Mthiyane, 35, was roped in to play the dead Zola Radebe's (Mutodi Neshehe's) long-lost daughter, she was viewed as another big name the longest-running SABC1 soapie has recruited.But over the last few weeks, Zitha is making a noticeable impact on the story line as a savvy civil engineer hell-bent on reviving her father's legacy. And viewers are warming to her execution of her craft."I don't have much background about the construction industry, I did a bit of research on the role. I consulted family members and friends to get an insight on what the industry is about," said Mthiyane."Zitha has a R5-million inheritance left for her. She is prepared to do whatever to revive her father's legacy. She gets even with the most powerful men in the industry."But viewers must brace themselves for a gripping duel between Zitha and the revered Jack Mabaso (Vusi Kunene) as the two wrestle for control of the construction company .Things could get so heated that the duo could end up between the sheets."The next episodes are going to be interesting. Jack is a married man, but Zitha is prepared to engage him on many fronts, even fight him to get what she believes belongs to her," was all Mthiyane had to say.The former SA Pop Stars finalist said her focus at the moment was on "growing my character" after the producers gave her a lifeline on the second biggest soapie in the country after Uzalo, also on SABC 1."I'm pouring all my energy on the production, it's taking most of my time."Besides being a TV actress, Mthiyane is a seasoned stage entertainer and singer of note.
