 Carlos Queiroz, Hugo Broos and Herve Renard are leading the race to take over the vacated post, while SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter and England's Roy Hodgson are outsiders for the position.Moroccan coach Renard is also a target of west African giants Ghana, who are looking to replace the departed Avram Grant after he failed to win the Africa Cup of Nations title.According to reports in Ghana, Renard has submitted his CV for the post along with the likes of Georges Leekens and Milutin Sredojevic.With his success on the continent with Zambia and Ivory Coast, Ghana will have him as one of their leading candidates for the vacant position.Broos, who has worked with Mamelodi Sundowns right back Anele Ngcongca at Genk in Belgium, is highly rated by Safa and his success with Cameroon at the Afcon in Gabon means he meets one of the criteria set out by Safa that a candidate must have won an Afcon title.Queiroz knows South African football well, having coached Bafana previously. He is one of Safa president Danny Jordaan's favourites for the position. Hodgson has recently been linked with the Leicester City job after Claudio Ranieri was sacked on Friday.Bafana need a new coach who will start preparing for next month's friendly matches against Angola and Guinea-Bissau. These matches will give the new man an idea of which players he can use for the 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifiers and the 2019 Afcon qualifiers later this year.
