 The media personality and entrepreneur joined Vuma in June as part of a radio venture that saw him broadcast simultaneously on Vuma FM and Rise FM.Vuma FM station manager Pearl Sokhulu told TshisaLIVE on Friday that the station and Sbu had decided to end their relationship because their brands were no longer aligned.We felt like the station and Sbu were growing in different directions and that we needed to make a change. It was a mutual decision. We are grateful to have had Sbu on our station. He has been an incredible asset Pearl said.Sbu said that his passion for empowering younger people was a big reason for his departure from the station. I feel great to have been part of the Vuma Family. I am going to miss my listeners and my team. It was a new territory for me and I learnt a lot about myself from it.
