 The good old academic is also allegedly a stallion in bed.But now his relationship with a young Pretoria woman has ended in tears after she took him to court for the maintenance of their young child.According to relatives of the 35-year-old woman, Gutto, 66, has been a sweet father to the boy child since his birth five years ago but allegedly reneged on his commitments towards the end of last year.The next of kin, who did not want to be named, said Gutto's alleged somersault happened after he rekindled his romance with his ex and mother of two of his other children."Shadrack and [name withheld] have been having a fantastic relationship until this woman reappeared in the picture."I think she started making her way back into his life when she realised that he was going on retirement at the end of last year."We suspect that she wants to get a lion's share of his pension money."So, my cousin also felt that if she did not take action to secure the future of her son, then her child could face a bleak future."All she wants is for Shadrack to commit that he would take financial responsibility for the child until he is old enough to take care of himself. For now, she is demanding R4500 per month," said the relative.Gutto referred questions to his lawyer Mmuso Matlala of MSMM Incorporated.Matlala confirmed they would be appearing in court tomorrow and said they were going to challenge the woman's claims."My client has never defaulted on maintenance for his child. The woman is demanding that Gutto set up a trust fund for the child from his pension."We are going to show up in court and prove to the maintenance officer that my client has never defaulted on maintenance and therefore prove that her claims are baseless," said Matlala.He accused the woman of trying to milk Gutto's pension using her child.Relating how her cousin and Gutto became an item, the relative said the pair met in 2007 through work and only started dating four years later."She told me that when they started hitting it [off], she was pregnant within two months. He insisted on not using condoms from the word go despite her reservations. By the time she got on contraceptives, it was too late as she was already preggies."Shadrack never questioned anything and met with her parents to pay his dues. He paid R20000 cash and even gave my cousin's mother his old Nissan bakkie as part of the damages and has been paying maintenance ever since."He loved his child because he is the only son. His other four children are all girls."Now suddenly he is bringing up issues of abortion which he never spoke about when my cousin fell pregnant," said the cousin.
