 Suffocate, as he is known on the popular e.tv soapie, began acting in 1988 and has never looked back."I wasn't looking at this thing as a career - it was more about making money and a way to get famous," he says."My primary school teachers actually forced me to replace an actor and take the lead role in a school play," he laughs.Mabaso was a theatre actor for 15 years before his first TV break. "I probably attended more auditions than I cared to count," he says ."In 2004 I got called for Hotel Rwanda - and I got the part almost instantly. I guess I was hungry for work and to showcase myself and my craft."I again auditioned on set with Don Cheadle in the same year and was cast there and then as the lieutenant."He has since become a seasoned actor, warming his way into the hearts of Mzansi screen lovers.The 42-year-old reveals that playing Suffocate is one of the most difficult things he has ever done. "Many people think there is no difference between me and Suffo but the truth is that the two are completely different people," he says."Suffo is a man with a gun in his pocket and is very business-driven, but as for his choice in women, two wives and cheating, it's not my style."Often seen as the number one tsotsi on TV, he says being "quiet" is the only thing he has in common with Suffo."Mduduzi is a one-woman man and a family man, very creative and passionate about my craft and the arts," he says.Mabaso says his favourite role was when he played Manyisa in the SABC2 eight-part film series, Heartlines ."That role was very interesting because the character and I shared the same things, like being humble and quiet," he says.The strict father of four strongly discourages his kids against a career in showbiz.For aspiring actors, he says youngsters must beware of substance abuse."If you manage to pair your talent with a good education, then you are coming up with a bomb," he says."But if you are not academically good, then you must grow a third layer of skin."
