 An artist manager, who did not want to be named as he works close to A-Reece, said the pair called it quits when they stopped having time to see each other."A-Reece really wanted a future with this girl. He always told us how she was focused and hard-working but their schedules were forever clashing."At first they tried to make time for each other. I don't know what went wrong. There was a time when Natasha had a lot of shoots and could not make time for the relationship. This year, things got worse. They did not even get to spend Valentine's Day together. They broke up at the beginning of January," said the source.
