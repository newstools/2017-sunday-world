 This after Machaka won a court application to attach the provincial league's properties to recoup monies owed to him.The league had failed to comply with a court order to pay for Machaka's legal costs, which amounted to more than R300000.Sunday World can reveal that after several attempts by the league's office bearers to dodge the sheriff - by locking their offices to stop them from attaching goods and furniture - the court ordered a locksmith to assist the sheriff in executing his duties in a raid set for Wednesday. But upon hearing of the pending visit by the sheriff and the locksmith, the league's leaders allegedly called an urgent meeting with their elders.Machaka and the league have been fighting for the past two years after Machaka was suspended on allegations that he called the league's secretary, Che Selane, a drunkard and an EFF member. He took the organisation to court twice and won on both occasions.Machaka, a qualified lawyer and deputy director of legal services at the Limpopo transport department, confirmed he was summoned to a meeting to discuss his legal bill and the court action against the youth league."All along, they didn't take me seriously and they have been playing hide and seek with the sheriff. So I decided to go back to court to ask for the inclusion of the locksmith," he said.He said the Monday meeting with ANC officials was fruitful and they have committed to finding solutions to the problem. "We have given them seven days to settle the legal bill, failing which will see us returning to the office with the sheriff to fulfil the court order," he said.Sunday World has seen a letter drafted by Machaka's attorney, Ernest Rammela, to ANC provincial secretary Knocks Seabi, treasurer Danny Msiza and the youth league leaders, who have all acknowledged receipt of the documents. The letter states that the ANC has until February 10 to pay the money.Limpopo ANCYL spokesman Matome Moremi said: "The ANCYL has no property and therefore would not comment on the story."The league also has another pending legal action filed by its Mopani regional chairman, Peter Ngobeni, who is challenging his year-long suspension from the organisation. Ngobeni was never subjected to any disciplinary hearing a year after he was suspended.
