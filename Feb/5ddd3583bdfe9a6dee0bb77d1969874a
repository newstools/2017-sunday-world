 Boity will make her debut on Monday, 10 April, on the popular etv soapie.She will play the role of Luscious Lu, described as a feisty radio presenter. Furthermore, the character oozes confidence and intimidates other women by just walking into the room. I ve always played sweet, innocent characters that people assume I am, Boity expressed in a statement. This character is going to allow me to show people that I also have a bitchy side, just like everyone else. I ve never worked with a lot of the actors on Rhythm City so this is going to be a whole new space for me. I also feel like I haven t acted in a while so I have to work extra hard to be ultra-prepared.
