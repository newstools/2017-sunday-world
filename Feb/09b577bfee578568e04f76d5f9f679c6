 Amakhosi are fourth on the Absa Premiership standings, just one point behind leaders SuperSport United, but the players feel they could be high up had it not been for drawing six of their 15 league games.Defender Lorenzo Gordinho has revealed that during the team's bad patch, the players put their heads together and agreed that more effort was needed to improve their performances.As a result, Chiefs managed two wins in a row before the six-week break owing to the Africa Cup of Nations. Gordinho, who was yesterday named the Absa Premiership Player of the Month for August/September, believes everyone is now on the same page."We are raring to get going. We want to hit the ground running and continue where we left off," he said."It is about coming together and realising that we are a team."It is about dealing with the pressure together and not let one guy deal with it alone," added Gordinho, who recently committed to the club by signing a new three-year deal.Goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune concurred: "We could have been far, but we dropped a lot of points [in the first round]," noted the 29-year-old.He added that head coach Steve Komphela was playing his part and the ball is now in the players' court to finish the job."It is for us [as players] who go onto the field to take it to another level, and that didn't happen last year. Hopefully this year things will improve."We've got great players, but I think some of us were not pushing one another to a level where the club wants us to be," Khune admitted.Chiefs will kick off their second half of the season when they host Free State Stars at FNB Stadium tonight (7.30pm).Amakhosi beat Ea Lla Koto 2-0 in September.
