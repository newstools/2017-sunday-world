 This is where new kid on the block, Johannesburg-based Eastern Cape promoter Sandile Xaka introduced himself to the boxing fraternity with a development tournament in July last year.Xaka, whose meritorious work earned him a nomination for BSA's most promising promoter of 2016, has put together a nine-bout card dubbed "Young Gladiators 3"."That is the continuation of our development series," said Xaka, whose maiden tournament gave the paying public real value for its money as all boxers in the bill fought their hearts out."Most boxers on the bill are the boys that we started with to make sure that we grow together," he said of this year's showdown.They are Percy "Cool Guy" Mkhize, Jeff "911" Magagane, Rofhiwa "War Child" Maemu, Hloni "Superstar" Maboko and Sifiso "The Gold" Hlongwane, Chris "Tyson" Monyai and Faraday "The Killer" Mukandila. Most of these young guns are trained in Linden by Alan Toweel Junior.Mkhize and Maemu will be looking at making an impression following their failures to win the Gauteng provincial flyweight and WBF international featherweight straps, respectively.Mkhize will face Nyelisani "The Rose of Limpopo" Thagambega in a junior flyweight bout, while Maemu will take on Siphiwe Ntsangani.Both of these fights will be over six rounds.Maboko will face Luvo Ntlebi in the junior lightweight over six rounds with Hlongwane doing duty against Tyrone Murgatroyd in the featherweight class.Vusumuzi Nyauza will fight Lemogang Mapitsi in the bantamweight category, while Mukandila and Siyabonga Mabena will meet in the welterweight class.Sikho Nqothole and Andrew Gumbo will make their professional debuts. These bouts will be over four rounds.Monyai will be looking at nothing but a win against John Bopape in order for the ratings committee to reconsider him for a rating.Xaka said Magagane will headline the bill in his first defence of his Gauteng lightweight belt against Ayanda Nkosi over 10 rounds.
