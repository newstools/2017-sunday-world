 According to Mashaba's representative Claudio Bollo, the veteran coach is delighted that the case which was referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration will finally get underway today."The process starts with what is called conciliation. They have a mediator, who is the conciliator. This is where the two parties try to find common ground and see if they can reach an agreement. If there is no agreement, then the case will be taken to arbitration," said Bollo, who maintained they have a strong case against Safa.Mashaba, 66, whose R500000 a month contract was due to run until mid 2018, was axed after he was found guilty of gross misconduct, gross insubordination and violating the communications policy of Safa.Reinstatement is Mashaba's first prize, but compensation will suffice if that does not work out.Safa, though, believe they did everything by the book and the matter is likely to go the arbitration route and even further if one of the parties are not happy with the outcome.Mashaba's legal representatives had requested Safa not to appoint a new coach while the matter is being resolved.The football governing body released a statement last month to say they will only confirm an appointment of a new coach next month.
