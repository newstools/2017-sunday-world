 In true soapie fashion, Ncayiyana steps into the character of the ever-troublesome Phindi, the irritating side dish hellbent on rocking the world of Ndumiso and Gontse, played by Sithole and Zwane respectively."Viewers must brace themselves for drama they have never experienced before as Phindi is back from her home town," said Ncayiyana.The young thespian sounds excited to make her second stint on the soapie after her character was phased out when drastic changes were made to the story line."I had a very tender role the first time around. Phindi had to go to KwaZulu-Natal, but on her return she wants to carry on from where they left off with her man (Ndumiso)."She is looking forward to making Gontse's life a living hell. Ndumiso does not even know that his ex-girlfriend is back in town."Ncanyiya, 24, hails from Gamalakhe township near Port Shepstone in KwaZulu-Natal. She comes from a community theatre acting background.
