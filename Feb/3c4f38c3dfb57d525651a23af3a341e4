 The Swede has said all the right things since his appointment on Monday and he admitted that he has a huge task on his hands. I am going to do what I normally do and I think that is the thing that Orlando Pirates want from me also he said. But of course I have seen them play in a few games and they are a very talented group of players but a little less of confidence I think. We have to go back to basics and start a little bit all over. I am not going to change everything and will sit down with the staff and the coaches and discuss what we can do better. I think we have to wait and see because often football is no quick fix."It takes some time and the situation Pirates find themselves in seven or eight games in a row without a win (it s actually nine games) I think it is also important to try and win a game as quickly as possible to get some happiness and laughing again in the locket room. I suppose they are a little bit down. The Bucs fans nicknamed themselves Happy People after the R Kelly hit song in the days when the club purred like a well-fed tiger and peerless R&amp;B king's steppers' groove would reverberate in stadiums around the country.It remains to be seen if Jonevret can take them back to those days and move them away from the current malaise.
