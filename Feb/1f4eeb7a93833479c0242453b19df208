"I need no one to push me because this is my passion. I am dedicated to what I do"Rasodi, like 77-year-old Bobby Goodman who has been putting boxing bouts together for his American countryman Don King for over two decades, is so passionate about what he does that his work ethic has outdone his age.At 74, Rasodi is the tower of strength for internationally renowned Golden Gloves Promotions since he began doing duty for Rodney Berman when the former attorney ventured into boxing 39 year ago.Rasodi, originally from Polokwane but now based in Orlando East, Soweto, was deservedly crowned the country's top matchmaker for 2016 at BSA's annual boxing award ceremony at Durban's ICC Hall last Friday evening."I would not have been able to show my true potential if it was not for Rodney who showed faith in me," said Rasodi, whose strength is attending every boxing tournament in the province so that he knows what is out there."I need no one to push me because this is my passion. I am dedicated to what I do and fortunately I have worked and still work with a team which has a vision," he said."I am excited to have won this award. I want to thank everybody at Golden Gloves, especially Rodney, BSA and my family. It has been a long journey."For any boxing promoter to stage a tournament, they must have a matchmaker.Those individuals arrange bouts between boxers.They look over boxers' fight records and match opponents evenly. Their job is to create interesting boxing matches that will give the crowds a thrill. They work for promoters and not fans.Matchmaking is an art, not science. Once the purpose of the matches is established, the next question a matchmaker asks is: "How big is the budget?"Matchmakers have a far-reaching network of contacts. Some they trust; some they don't. As soon as they have their orders, they pick up the telephone, start making calls and then there is a boxing tournament.
