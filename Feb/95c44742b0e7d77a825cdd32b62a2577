"Every time there was a quarrel she would pack her stuff and leave"Sunday World has learnt that Khoza moved out of their place in Tzaneen in December.Mokgobi has now allegedly blocked her attempt to return home this week.Khoza allegedly left on several occasions since their white wedding in May 2015, but returned after she apologised to the ANC veteran for her alleged faux pas.Mokgobi, the former mayor of Mopani District Municipality, confirmed Khoza vacated their nuptial pad, but refused to disclose the reason behind their separation."She moved out of the house on December 26, but I'm not prepared to discuss the reasons for our separation with the media. I serve God not individuals, and I leave everything in the hands of God," he said.Khoza said: "I don't want to talk about my private life in the media."The couple's close friend, who did not want to be named, alleged Khoza dumped Mokgobi on the Day of Goodwill after he reprimanded her for henpecking him in public.The friend said Khoza arrived on Monday accompanied by her uncles in a bid to resolve their dispute, but Mokgobi sent them packing."After they introduced themselves as her uncles, Humphrey told them that he didn't want to hear anything from them and ordered them to leave his property immediately. They scurried away without looking back," said the friend.The friend also alleged Mokgobi complained Khoza verbally abused him and attacked him with missile-like cooking pots and plates whenever they quarrelled."Every time there was a quarrel she would pack her stuff and leave. After a few days she would apologise and come back. He is done with her, hence he chased them away on Monday," said the friend.Mokgobi and Khoza's 2015 wedding was dramatic itself after his first wife Matshidiso Mathabatha announced she didn't bless their union.Mathabatha told guests that Mokgobi was a deadbeat dad.He hit back at her and accused her of being a "restless dog" that cheated on him.
