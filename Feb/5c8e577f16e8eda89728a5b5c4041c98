"We don't know if he sent the photo unwittingly or deliberately"It was not known whether the man, who is also a senior ANC official in the province, sent the penis meme by design or by accident to a WhatsApp group messaging platform of law makers.Limpopo ANC spokeswoman Khumbudzo Ntshavheni declined to comment and referred us to ANC party caucus spokesman Phuti Lekganyane.Lekganyane said it was a personal matter. "We regard this as a personal matter and our view is that the affected member must comment on the matter himself," he said, adding he forwarded the question to the politician.He said despite the alleged incident they still had confidence in their comrade. "This could be viewed as one of the many ploys against the person"Attempts to reach the politician drew a blank as he did not answer calls and ignored the text messages sent to him.Two senior ANC members, who did not want to be named said it appeared the man was chatting with fellow legislature members and chatting to a female contact at the same time when the alleged mishap happened.The chat group includes Langa Bhodlani of the Democratic Alliance and Dickson Masemola of the ANC."He sent the picture of the penis to the group instead of sending it to the companion. We don't know if he sent the picture unwittingly or deliberately," said the ANC member.Another party member said some female members of the chat group were unhappy as they felt that their colleague was sexually harassing them."You see there are elderly women in the chat group and I'm told they were unhappy with him. But they all decided to close ranks because he is their fellow comrade and they protect each other."
