"I'm now raising the child who is not mine, my boyfriend left me because of being wrongfully diagnosed of HIV"The woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child, got the shock of her life in August 2011 when nurses at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Ekurhuleni told her that she was HIV-positive after subjecting her to a battery of pre-natal tests.She discovered later, after losing the father of her child and taking ARVs, that she was in fact HIV-negative.As if that was not enough, the woman, 36, left the hospital carrying a wrong baby in her arms after the nurses mixed the children up at birth.News of the woman's heart-rending tale came to the fore when she ran to Prophet Paseka "Mboro" Motsoeneng for divine intervention on Tuesday.Mboro confirmed that the heart-broken woman came to him for prayers and asked her to come to his church today."I told her when she phoned me about this matter that she should come so we can pray together so that she can get her child back. I don't want to delve much into the allegation because this is a legal matter, so you'd rather speak to her."The unemployed mother of two poured her heart out when she spoke to us. She said she was admitted to the hospital after going into labour six years ago. The woman, who discovered she was preggies with a baby girl after a series of ultra-sound scans, said she was attending pre-natal check-ups at the hospital until she gave birth."They told me that I was HIV-positive and shouldn't breast-feed my daughter when she was born. I was so devastated because I was not cheating."She said she went home and told her boyfriend, who immediately broke up with her.The hospital immediately enrolled her on its ARV programme until she gave birth.She said after giving birth one of the nurses came and showed her her baby girl and she was chuffed.But she got the shock of her life when they gave her a baby boy a day before she was discharged from hospital."When I asked them why they gave me a boy and not my girl, they mocked me," she said.She said the hospital referred her to Vosloorus Clinic for further treatment for HIV. "When I got there they took my blood for tests. But the results came back negative," she said.The woman said she confirmed the child was not hers when she dragged her boyfriend to the Boksburg Maintenance Court for papgeld in 2013."He insisted that he wanted paternity tests and the results came out saying we were both not the boy's parents," she said.She said the hospital immediately located her child after she informed it of the faux pas."After several counselling sessions with the other woman, they failed to give me back my child. I'm struggling to raise this child with a child grant only as I'm unemployed."I'm now raising the child who is not mine, my boyfriend left me because of being wrongfully diagnosed of HIV. I would be a married woman today had they not wrongly tested me positive."The other thing is that I am struggling to help this child in terms of traditional rituals that need to be performed for him. I don't know his surname and his forebears. That is why I want prophet Mboro to help me because I'm emotionally drained and don't know what to do," she said, adding that the matter is now before the North Gauteng High Court and will be heard in March next year.The other woman said: "My lawyer is dealing with this matter, so I can't comment."Gauteng health spokesman Prince Hamnca said: "We are investigating this matter, as soon as we have more details we will inform [you] accordingly."
