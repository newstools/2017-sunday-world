 This is what veteran playwright and Muvhango producer Duma Ndlovu told scores of young performers who came to audition for The Lion King musical at the Market Theatre on Friday."The Lion King can change your life, as you are likely to spend close to five years overseas," he said.About 200 places are up for grabs in what is seen as the biggest musical and theatre production in Mzansi.Performers who will clinch their roles after a vigorous audition process will tour 10 different countries, including China, Mexico, Germany and the US."We are looking for a particular body type and voice, all characters in The Lion King have different traits, so we want artists to suit those traits," he said.He added that those who are young and well-built have higher chances of making it."Of course, some are more talented than others and some more prepared than others," he said.He further said that those who have had formal training come to auditions more prepared.Julia Sibeko, a performing artist graduate from Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), said this was her first time auditioning for a musical."I made it to the next level, and I will be back again on Sunday (today)," she said.She said he biggest challenge was controlling her nerves."I had a nervous start but quickly regained my calm," she added.
