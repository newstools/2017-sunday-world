 Times Media Digital shines a light on the matches and picks out the key talking points.All matches kick off at 7.30pm.PLATINUM STARS VS ORLANDO PIRATESConvincing victories for Kaizer Chiefs BidVest Wits and Cape Town City pile the pressure on Orlando Pirates who start 2017 outside of the top eight.There is still no sign of a new coach at Mayfair but their January transfer window business has seem them shift some of the dead wood in the squad in favour of decent acquisitions.James Okwuasa and Marc van Heerden strengthen the defence while Dove Wome and Thembinkosi Lorch add attacking options.Forward Tendai Ndoro holds the key though. He netted 23 goals in the 2016 calendar year making him by far the leading forward in the country.Stars have added modestly to their squad and could give a debut to former Chiefs winger Abia Nale. They should be better in the second half of the season than the first which has seen them flirt near the relegation zone.Stars won this fixture 2-1 last season their only victory in their last eight games against Pirates.SUPERSPORT UNITED VS LAMONTVILLE GOLDEN ARROWSSuperSport would also have watched as most of their main title rivals all picked up excellent wins last night but face a tough start against a resilient Lamontville Golden Arrows who are well coached by Clinton Larsen.Mandla Masango is in line for a debut for the home side while Arrows could start all three of their new boys returning defender Nkosinathi Mthiyane (from Orlando Pirates on loan) and forwards Chiukepo Msowoya (Big Bullets Malawi) and Knox Mutizwa (Bidvest Wits loan).For all their good form this season Arrows are winless in six matches but did win away at SuperSport two years ago.This fixture usually provides a positive result with the last eight meetings seeing SuperSport win five Golden Arrows two and just a single draw.BLOEMFONTEIN CELTIC VS MAMELODI SUNDOWNSSundowns start the year away in the Free State and starting life after Keagan Dolly whose debut for French Ligue 1 side Montpellier on Tuesday night should provide inspiration to the rest of the Brazilians squad.The Sundowns players have had their first rest in 18 months after campaigning in African club competition and now face a daunting fixture list in 2017 which will hold little respite either.Celtic have been something of a bogey team for them in the last few years though recording 5-0 and 3-1 away wins at Sundowns and also knocking Pitso Mosimane s side out of the MTN8 in 2015.But having said that they have not recorded a home win against Sundowns in the league for 11 years since a 1-0 triumph in 2006.POLOKWANE CITY VS MARITZBURG UNITEDBoth of these sides have top eight aspirations this season a very achievable goal looking at the quality of their squads.City are currently in fifth and have adapted well under coach Luc Eymael who probably does not get the plaudits he deserves for the job he has done in Limpopo to take the unfashionable club to fifth place in the standings.He has signed up winger Tlou Segolela whose career has faded in recent seasons but could be set for lift-off once again under the Belgian.Roger de Sa makes his bow as Maritzburg coach and will be eager first and foremost to move away from the relegation zone and turn the club s habit of drawing into wins.City have won the last four meetings between these sides.
