 Tyamara, who sold millions of albums and raked in millions of rands in gigs and royalties, was kicked out of the townhouse he was renting in Mondeor, Joburg south, by its owner while he was lying on his deathbed.The townhouse's owner Ben Mokoena confirmed that he kicked Lundi out of the unit while he was fighting for his life at Edenvale Hospital."Lundi and I had an agreement that when the place is sold to the new owner he should move out. The place was sold on December 15 and the new owner wanted to move in quickly, that's why he had to leave," he said.Asked why the unit was still empty, Mokoena said there was a problem at the deeds office which delayed the transfer of the unit to the new owner.Sunday World learnt that after he was kicked out, Tyamara sent a female friend, who is known to us, a WhatsApp message and pleaded with her to lend him R950 to pay a storage fee for his furniture at an unidentified storage facility.The friend said she told him he should give her the name of the storage company so she could transfer the cash to them."But some woman, who only identified herself as Thobeka, took the phone from him and told me that I should give her the cash. I said I would do an eWallet transfer later."The friend said despite her promising to transfer the money, Tyamara phoned her frantically and told her that the landlord was kicking him out and he needed the money quickly.She said the phone call was followed by a WhatsApp message on New Year's Day in which he lamented that she did not send him the money for storage fees as promised.The message, seen by us, reads: "Waze wadlala ngam ipahlaza zasendlini ke nana pls (You played with me, my furniture babes please!)"The friend replied that she was coming to visit him at the hospital."I indeed visited him and when I arrived there, I found this Thobeka woman seated by his bedside. He pleaded with me to give him the money as the storage people wanted it immediately. I think he was scared they would either sell the furniture or throw it out."The friend said she learnt in the news later that Tyamara had died."The truth is Lundi was suffering. He would call me and ask me for money to buy groceries and complained that Anele Hlazo, who was his manager, was the reason he was broke."I would either give him R1000 to buy food or buy groceries for him. My heart bleeds when I see Anele going around as if he is God. The truth is Lundi hated Anele wholeheartedly," she said.Thobeka ignored our calls and text messages.Hlazo said he would tell his side of the story after Tyamara's funeral today.
