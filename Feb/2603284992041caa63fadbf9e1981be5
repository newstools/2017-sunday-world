 On etv avid Scandal! fans got to witness vixen Yvonne Thebe s (Kgomotso Christopher) not so perfect wedding to Damon Bradbury (Craig Urbani).Amid all the soap opera drama, if there was one thing that everyone agreed on was that the blushing bride looked breathtaking.Sporting a chic chignon, the bride slipped into a stunning embellished sheath wedding gown, with a matching creamy overlay.According to Christopher the dress was flown all the way from Bahrain thanks to the incomparable Corlene Furstenburg from the Scandal! wardrobe department . Shooting the episode was fun and crazy. It was real-life stuff. There is a programme that everyone is obsessed with in the country, Our Perfect Wedding, it was exactly like that. Weddings are unpredictable and viewers will get to see that, Christopher explained ahead of the episode airing last night. I was so nervous too and had wedding jitters. It was my second television wedding, my character on Isidingo had a wedding too about two years ago, but this one was my favourite so far. Despite the outcome of the episode, it was amazing to see the trouble the Scandal! wardrobe department went through to make sure that it was as authentic as possible. The dress was flown all the way from Bahrain. In last night's episode viewers saw Yvonne's whole world explode in front of her eyes. She was left stranded at the alter after her husband-to-be Damon was a runaway groom as the police tried to catch him after his shady dealings.
