 The board comprises Muditambi "Ntambi" Ravele - the first female chairperson - Dr Peter Ngatane, Khulile Radu, Luthando Jack, Mandisinde Gcilitshana and Zandisile Kabini. It was appointed in May 2014 by Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula and its term ends in May. But Ravele's board hit a snag in the development of women's boxing due to lack of support from some promoters who would not feature women in their tournaments.BSA made a commitment to ensuring that every tournament that is sponsored by government features one or two women's bouts - but this only affects certain promoters.Rating is virtually non-existent. In some weight classes, there is only the champion and it is unclear how they will claim ownership of the championship belt. The required number of defences is five.Nwabisa Mbopha last fought when she won the super middleweight belt in 2014.Ravele acknowledged the challenges the board faces, chief among these being the need to attract more female boxers in different weight categories and to try to retain those already on their database."They come, spend a year without action, get frustrated and quit."Ravele added: "We intend to present plans about women boxing to the sports minister to intervene when it comes to financial support from provincial governments."She announced that there would be four women-only tournaments this quarter.
