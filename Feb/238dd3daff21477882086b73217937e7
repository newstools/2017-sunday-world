 This after the PSL tweeted on player transfer deadline that the 19-year-old son of the former world boxing champion has joined Highlands from Alexandra Black Aces. But it turned out that the young striker is actually registered with Highlands Park's MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) team.PSL spokesman Luxolo September confirmed Thobela was indeed registered under Highlands Park.The player said: "The deal happened a week ago," referring to his move to the MDC side.Thobela senior said: "The boy is a very strong striker. I tried to get him into boxing from an early age."He was very keen, he worked on the punching bag at home, and he would later complain that it was painful."It became clear that boxing was not for him, so he later switched to football and I am happy that he is pushing his passion."However, Highlands director Sinky Mnisi had earlier told Sowetan that "I do the signing of players, and I am telling you that we don't have that boy in our club".
