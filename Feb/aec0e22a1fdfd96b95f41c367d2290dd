 The first half of the campaign was characterised by supporters throwing missiles at coach Steve Komphela here, but he and the players were given a round of applause following the victory which keeps them within touching distance of Absa Premiership leaders Bidvest Wits.Celebrating his 10th year with Amakhosi, Siphiwe Tshabalala produced a moment of brilliance against the club where he first made a name for himself, to open the scoring for the hosts.He reminded supporters why Amakhosi were so eager to sign him all those years ago, even though he was carrying an injury at the time.From a free kick, the midfielder curled the ball into the Stars net, giving goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni no chance in the 18th minute.Boosted by their goal and the energetic supporters, the hosts needed a little over 10 minutes to extend their lead.It would come from the penalty spot, as Bernard Parker converted from the rebound after Ngobeni had saved his initial effort. Stars conceded the penalty after giving the ball away closer to the halfway line.Edmore Chirambadare stole the ball and, after running almost half the pitch, he was brought down in the box by Ngobeni. Willard Katsande - fresh from doing duty for Zimbabwe at the just-concluded Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon - wrapped things up just after the hour mark when he dribbled two players before calmly slotting the ball home.Stars had their moments. Mohammed Anas struck the upright in the 42nd minute, while Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune made some routine saves. Rooi Mahamutsa scored after 73 minutes from a free kick. Gustavo Paez, meanwhile, made his debut for Chiefs. He had one shot, which was off target.
