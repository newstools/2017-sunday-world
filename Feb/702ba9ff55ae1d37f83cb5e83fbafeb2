 This after the family court in Pretoria agreed with Mosito that the R5000 demanded by his baby mama for maintenance of their child was exorbitant.Mosito was dragged to court by the woman demanding an increase in the papgeld that the former Sundowns spokesman has been paying for their 14-year-old son.The mother told Sunday World that she took Mosito to court so she could receive extra financial support for their teenaged son as she was struggling to keep up with his needs.However, she said her efforts were thwarted by the law.She said the court dismissed her financial requests citing the fact that Mosito was supporting his child."I lost the case. According to the court, Mosito does support my child. That is what the court is saying. So we are required to sort out whatever extras we need for the child outside the court," she said.She refused to reveal the amount Mosito was paying every month for the child."I don't have anything more to add. The court said we should work things out together, with our son's input and involvement," she said.Mosito said there were no problems between him and the baby mama."We are fine. We are not fighting. The court dismissed the case because I support my child," he said.
