 The Brazilians' mentor guided his side to the CAF Super Cup triumph on Saturday, courtesy of a 1-0 win over TP Mazembe at Loftus Stadium.Defender Ricardo Nascimento netted from the penalty spot with eight minutes remaining.However, Sundowns's celebrations were cut short ahead of their Absa Premiership clash against Platinum Stars at Royal Bafokeng Stadium tomorrow night at 7.30pm.Except for the traditional pose with the Super Cup trophy on Saturday, Mosimane's team didn't have much time to throw a wild party into the night.Even during the post-match press briefing, Mosimane was eager to have captain Hlompho Kekana and Lucky Mohomi leave the conference room for a shower.Sundowns - who were back at training yesterday - have to play catch-up as they are six matches behind log leaders Kaizer Chiefs and other title chasers."There are no guarantees. I can say we can win the league, but I'm not sure," admitted Mosimane."We are aware that games in hand are not games won. We need to win the game on Tuesday [tomorrow]," he said, adding that he would take his strongest squad to Rustenburg.Mosimane expressed confidence in his players that they would remain focused and hungry despite the team's success over the past year."The one thing I'm lucky with is I have players who are responsible and look after themselves. It helps because if you are busy outside football, it will tell," Mosimane said."Even after we won the [CAF] Champions League [in October], we were training the next day because we had Polokwane City and we were on the back foot in the league."This [CAF Super Cup) is done and I'm happy. Now, [we have] two more cups [the Premiership and Nedbank Cup] to go and we have to try and win them all."l Sundowns will begin the defence of their Champions league crown against Kampala Capital City Authority next month. The Ugandan side lost 2-1 to Angolan side Primeiro di Agosto yesterday but advanced on the away goals rule after a 2-2 aggregate scoreline.
