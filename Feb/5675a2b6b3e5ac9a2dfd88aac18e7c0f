 Maritzburg, like Stars, have made a coaching change by bringing in Roger de Sa, who started his tenure with a 1-1 draw against Polokwane City away from home.Seventh-placed Maritzburg welcome Amakhosi tomorrow (Harry Gwala Stadium at 8.15pm).The Team of Choice would want to dominate and make sure Chiefs do not get time and space on the ball like they did in their 3-1 victory over Ea Lla Koto at FNB Stadium on Tuesday.Looking ahead to the clash, Chiefs coach Steve Komphela said they would prepare thoroughly to make sure they are ready for whatever Maritzburg throw at them."It's almost the same scenario [as Free State Stars]. It was difficult to figure out how they were going to come across and the same thing [will] happen with Maritzburg."Roger de Sa went in there and he had about four weeks to work with the team and they've had business during the [player transfer] window period," said Komphela."How then do you approach that? You prepare yourself in the best manner ever because you cannot plan against them purely because you do not have all the information that is current."You have to be on your toes in every aspect and then in the game you will read the situations that need solutions."A big boost for Komphela is the return to form of striker Bernard Parker, who has scored three goals is as many matches.
