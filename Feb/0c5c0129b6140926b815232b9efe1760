 Karuru was released by Chiefs at the same time as Morgan Gould, Siboniso Gaxa and Reyaad Pieterse among others during the club's massive clear-out in May last year following a trophy-less season.Now the 28-year-old Karuru has been given a lifeline to resurrect his profession by his former national team coach Joey Antipas at Usuthu in the National First Division (NFD)."This is my second chance in South Africa to showcase my talent. I am targeting a return to the Absa Premiership [with AmaZulu]."I am working hard to get into the starting XI because I have already made my debut from the bench," the Zimbabwean national told Sowetan yesterday.He continued: "The NFD is more tactical than physical, but that is not a problem for me because I am used to coach Antipas' tactics as we have worked together before."He is like a father to me and that will help a lot."Antipas, who is also Zimbabwean, is confident his new recruit will add value to the team. "I believe he can give us another dimension in play and he's also a very creative type of player."He's also played in Europe, in France. He will add depth into the team," the coach told his club's website.Karuru will hope to make his second appearance for Usuthu when they host Real Kings at Princess Magogo Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm).He failed to sparkle at Chiefs after joining them amid fanfare in 2014. He was limited to just two starts and five substitute appearances with no goal.
