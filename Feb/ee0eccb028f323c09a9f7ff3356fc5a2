 However, the book is not a biography. Publisher Thabiso Mahlape confirmed to Sunday World that the book, titled Bonang Matheba - From A to B, will share details about the TV personality's success.So it is safe to say, it is more like a how-to book. Mahlape says Radio 702 presenter Gugu Mhlungu and Matheba collaborated to narrate the story.Mahlape, the first black woman to own an imprint of Jacana Media - BlackBird Books - says she has been pining to tell stories about black lives."I have decided to publish stories of black authors. There are many talented black authors out there."Mahlape has already published numerous best-sellers such as My Father My Monster by Mcintosh Polela and Malaika wa Azania's Memoirs of a Born Free.Her journey to becoming a publisher has seen its fair share of ups and downs. She first studied electrical engineering before deciding that publishing was her life."I wanted to study journalism but on the day I was supposed to leave for 'varsity to study journalism, Eskom called offering me a bursary to study engineering at Technikon Witwatersrand (now the University of Johannesburg)."I failed dismally and subsequently lost the bursary," she says.She applied to study journalism at the University of Pretoria but was admitted to publishing instead."The administrator told me the journalism course was full."She advised me to take publishing instead as the course was not entirely different from journalism," Mahlape says.The rest, as they say, is history.
