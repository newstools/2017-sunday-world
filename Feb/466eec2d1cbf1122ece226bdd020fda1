I take the criticism with a pinch of salt," she responded to her critics.Makgotso M said it was a struggle to get her first acting break."When you are trying to get your foot in the door, everyone says 'no' in the beginning, which was my case for years. It just so happened that everyone said 'yes' at the same time."On her role in Saints &amp; Sinners, she said Nandi loves the finer things in life and "embraces the blesser life because it's an easy way for her to get what she wants and cannot afford".She said she got the role after working with the producers before, at Penguin Films, where she had a small cameo role on the SABC1 drama Sokhulu &amp; Partners."So I didn't really have to do much to convince them as I usually would, because they were aware of my capabilities."Her other projects include My Perfect Family, Ayanda and the Mechanic, Mutual Friends, Sober Companion and the short film Guns and Petal's.Makgotso M divulged she was a theatre freak: "I just love the stage. I won a pageant when I was eight years old. I just loved the feeling I got when I was on stage. It was exhilarating and exciting."She said the more she studied acting, the more she developed a respect for the craft."Acting is a powerful tool, it can do anything from addressing social ills or merely make people laugh."Born in Alberton, Johannesburg, she grew up in England.
