 While IT and private security millionaire and President Jacob Zuma's friend Roy Moodley said he would be taking his wife to Paris, France, mining magnate Tim Tebeila has other plans.Moodley, a flamboyant Durban businessman who splashed millions on his 60th birthday bash in 2014, said he had planned a romantic getaway. Known for not sparing a cent when he throws parties, Moodley said he was whisking his wife Mumsy to the city of love, where she will be offered anything her heart desires."I want her to choose whatever she wants while we are there," he said.As for Tebeila, 50, he will be splashing out for the elderly and spending a day with them at an old age home on Valentine's Day."My plan is to celebrate it with random acts of kindness and give love to the less fortunate. I want them [elderly people] to know that they are cared for too," said Tebeila.He will go to the charity organisation armed with goodie bags and spend the day with senior citizens."I want to spend time to relax, listen and gain wisdom from those who walked the path before me."The greatest gift one can give someone is time, attention, love and concern."I never get tired of doing little things for others. Sometimes those little things occupy the biggest part of their hearts," added Tebeila.The owner of Sekoko Resources is known for his love of big cars with a Bentley Grand Convertible among the toys in his fleet.
