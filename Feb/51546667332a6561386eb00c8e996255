 When they last met at this stage in 2008, the Indomitable Lions boasted the likes of Samuel Eto'o and Geremi Njitap in their ranks.Egypt, on the other hand, were on a roll as defending champions then. Tonight at the Stade de I'Amitie (9pm, live on SuperSport 4) a brave, energetic Cameroonian side will attempt to succeed where their seniors failed: to overcome the Pharaohs in the final.Hugo Broos, the Cameroon coach, believes it's not mission impossible despite history being against his side, a team that last beat Egypt in 2002 en route to lifting the title."When you are in the final it means you're already one of two best sides at the tournament," Broos said following Thursday's 2-0 semifinal win over Ghana in Franceville."If anyone had said we would be in the final when we arrived here, they would have been ridiculed. But that has been our biggest motivation - the fact that no one expected us to make it this far."A dispirited Cameroon had to scramble for players last month as seniors such as Andre Onana and Joel Matip withdrew from their squad. For Broos that proved to be a blessing in disguise. Onana's place in goal was taken by Fabrice Ondoa, and he's been so exceptional that only Egypt's veteran Essam El-Hadary should rival him to the keeper of the tournament award.Other players like Christian Bassogog and Adolphe Teikeu enhanced their reputations with assured performances, eliminating hosts Gabon from Group A, favourites Senegal and Ghana this week."I have been a coach for 29 years," Belgian Broos said. "But I have yet to see a group of players like this. There are 23 of them and they are friends. In many teams you get players who are not playing being grumpy - not this bunch. They have made my job easier."Seven-times champions Egypt have the experience of winning key matches: they have lost only one final - in 1962.Matshe is in Gabon courtesy of SuperSport.
