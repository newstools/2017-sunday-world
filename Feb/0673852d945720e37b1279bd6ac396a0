 Yesterday, Ayanda revealed on Instagram how her life has been completely shaken up. After breaking and being teared into pieces ready to throw the towel... But MERCY SAID NO! Yebo many are the afflictions of the righteous BUT the Lord and only the Lord delivers them from ALL. Thank you to everyone praying for us loving us even thinking about us. @mawenzancwane insisted i take my first selfie today I will feel better. In another heartbreaking post, Ayanda writes:"The 5th!!!!! Has changed its complete meaning! For now it is a day of sorrow &amp; pain. I thank God for the blood of Jesus that speaks better things, because nothing makes sense for now. But because i rely on walking by faith because my sight is blurry. I find comfort knowing you are at peace and happy in the arms of the Lord. Rest well dear husband. In my ears i still hear your husky tinny voice that always charmed me whenever you open your mouth to speak . #TheNcwanesForLife"In January she posted a picture of herself next to her husband s grave. She said that it had only been 54 days since he had died but it still felt like yesterday. I can still smell your perfume feel your arms around me each morning. Only if there was a manual to walk this journey. Hmm.! But you said to us Wethembekile Baba i ll hold on to that my love.
