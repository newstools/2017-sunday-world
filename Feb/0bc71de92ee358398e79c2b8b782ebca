 A Joburg motorist claims that Gcaba crashed into him on the N3 in Woodmead, north of Joburg, in August last year.Alfred Radebe alleges that the Pirates player was drunk at the time of the accident and begged him not to involve police in the matter."I agreed to his request and even helped him pay half of his towing fees. He asked me to take the car to my house because rules at his residential complex did not allow him to store broken cars on the premises."He agreed to pay for the repairs to my car but has failed to do so up to this day. He only paid me back the money for the towing."I am now frustrated because he does not want to pay me. I have two damaged cars at my house including his. All I want is for him to pay me and then take away his damaged car," said Radebe.Radebe, who was driving his vintage 2006 BMW M3, said panelbeaters quoted him more than R170000 to get his wheels back on the road.He said he can't afford the repairs and was expecting Gcaba to make good on his promise."Instead of paying me I saw him at a garage in Midrand in November last year driving a brand new BMW X4. I confronted him at the garage about where he got the nerve to drive around in a new car while he still owed me."He apologised and told me that he had not bought that X4 but it was a courtesy car from BMW. He also said their office at Pirates paid them late and that is why he was delaying to pay me," he said.Gcaba, 31, did not confirm nor deny if he was involved in an accident with Radebe.He declined to speak to Sunday World but responded to SMSed questions by asking where we heard about the accident.After hearing that we interviewed Radebe about the allegations, he pretended not know the man. "Who's that now?" he asked.After obtaining pictures of the accident scene from Radebe, Sunday World independently verified the ownership of the BMW 428i and it was found that it belonged to Gcaba.Radebe said he had now taken legal action against Gcaba.
