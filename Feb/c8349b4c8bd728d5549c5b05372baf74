 Two music heavyweights, King Monada and hip-hop artist A-Reece, have snubbed the Metro FM Music Awards for different reasons.King Monada, of Oska Bhora Moreki fame, allegedly informed the station that he would not attend the event, which was held in Durban last night, as he wanted to spend time with his sick child.But the muso made a surprise turn at the Limpopo State of the Province Address (Sopa), which was held at the Jake Botes Hall in Polokwane on Friday.Our deep throat, who didn't want to be named, said he became aware of King Monada's presence at the Sopa when he was acknowledged by premier Stan Mathabatha during his address.The mole said King Monada was apparently invited by the Office of the Premier to attend the annual event."When people asked him what he was doing there as he was supposed to be next to his sick child, King Monada just ignored them. This is the man who said in the papers that he would not go to the Metros because his child was sick, so what the hell was he doing there? Why is he snubbing the awards, or has he just developed cold feet?" asked the mole jokingly.King Monada's manager Molao Rammalo confirmed that his charge did not attend the awards but attended the Sopa."Yes, I can confirm that he went there but he didn't perform. In fact, he was in Polokwane for something else and just popped in there and stayed for a while and left," he said.He refuted allegations that he snubbed the awards."Durban is very far and Polokwane is just one hour and thirty minutes from his house in Tzaneen. Also, it was going to be awkward for him to go to Durban because it would be seen as if he was out celebrating while his child was not well," he said.A-Reece said he snubbed the awards because he was no longer part of Ambitiouz Entertainment.Ambitiouz Entertainment boss Kgosi Mahumapelo confirmed Metro FM invited A-Reece to co-perform the song Ameni with other stable artists."He confirmed that he would be present but failed to pitch up, so there was nothing we could do," he said.Mahumapelo produced WhatsApp messages between him and the artist to back up the claims.SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago confirmed they wanted A-Reece to perform but he snubbed their invite."He said he couldn't because he left Ambitiouz Entertainment, and when they tried to book him separately he was not available," he said.A tipster said A-Reece was not happy with Metro FM after they asked Ambitiouz Records if the artist would not cause a scene at the awards after his fight with the recording stable."Although Kgosi told them that A-Reece was not a troublesome person, he couldn't guarantee them anything. He would have been happy for A-Reece to perform there as a sign that he does not hold a grudge against the boy, it is just pure business," said the mole.
