Our writers have not been able to craft a big story for him and because his is such a prominent character, it would have been shameful to just let him float through the season without a gripping storyline, Muvhango publicist Amanda Ngudle confirmed in a statement.Musina also confirmed his departure from the show, urging his fans to still catch him on investigative reality show Speak Out."Yes, I can confirm that I have left Muvhango. I have enjoyed my time on the show. Muvhango will always be home. For my fans, I will still be on Speak Out, and as far as acting is concerned, just watch the space, Musina said.
