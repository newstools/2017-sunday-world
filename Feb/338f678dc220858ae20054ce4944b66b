The night has a different rhythm, feel, and aesthetic to the dayThe city's main party suburb is always an entanglement of cars and bodies. There's always a lane of hovering vehicles, their hazard lights flashing, limbs and bass-lines pouring from the open doors.Always a current of club- goers claiming the night-street for pedestrians, willing to encounter strangers in ways they would not normally do during the day.From the one corner, where the club-cum-bar Kitchener's sits, all the way up to the next corner - next to the Bannister Hotel, people queue for the dancefloor and find solidarity in waiting.Someone argues with the bouncers, a child begs those in line, a dealer offers marijuana, a young woman yells to a friend across the street...Yet not too far away from the De Beer Street turbulence are inner city roads that only a few hours earlier were a knot of activity.Congestion dissipates with the daylight and these streets are left empty, creating a cavern in which pedestrian footsteps echo, and drivers move seamlessly from one near-redundant traffic light to the next.The night has a different rhythm, feel, and aesthetic to the day. This "second city", academic William Sharpe once said, "comes with its own geography and its own set of citizens".Scholars of urban studies are increasingly acknowledging that the discipline, and indeed the wider imagining of cities, is characterised by nyctophobia: a fear of the dark, and relatedly, the night. And as is so often the case, artists give us a creative language to describe and engage with that which was once impenetrable.Elsa Bleda's recent Nightscapesexhibition is one such example.The young photographer's images capture the serenity, mystery and other-worldliness of Johannesburg by night.A primary impetus for her work lies in the century-old Rupert Brooke quote that "cities, like cats, will reveal themselves after dark".Darkness often comes with a web of seedy associations.There are anxieties about criminals using the night as camouflage, about the vulnerabilities of women, and about the dangers of poorly lit roads.Darkness can also awaken the imagination, offering atmosphere for transgression, abandon and fantasy.Social anthropologist Julia Hornberger said of Johannesburg dusk: "Going forward into the night is like going backwards in time. Chipped corners on balconies heal, cracks in the plastering disappear .The night is a time for dreaming, for graffiti artists, for activists, lovers and dancers."Paradoxically, darkness is often the necessary backdrop for glistening electric illumination, with all the associations of developmental modernity and consumptive excess.Despite the ways in which electricity blackouts have brought Johannesburg residents into new encounters with the dark, much of our urban night lives take place amid a superfluity of light technologies - traffic lights, nightclub LEDs, police sirens or fluorescent towers in the distance. Light has been a mechanism to claim nocturnal time and territory - to make the dark habitable, exploitable, police-able, profitable and beautiful.Curated lighting is very much a part of the nighttime infrastructure - designating areas of safety, enchantment and surveillance, and then disappearing as day breaks.Braamfontein's after-dark nightscape is marked by the multi-coloured spectacle of the Nelson Mandela Bridge overhead, abrasive car lights, flashing billboards and flickering neon.Ever been to a nightclub during the day, without the darkness, the music, the ambient lighting and the intimacy of the crowd?It feels like a non-place.So much of our attachment to nightclub spaces is made from bodies in motion, set to carefully curated sound and light-scapes, all of which disappear at dawn.In urbanist AbdouMaliq Simone's words, we might begin to see "people as infrastructure".Human practices, the absence or presence of others, in the city gives places particular contours, creates obstruction or permissiveness, and alters the look and feel of a place.Moving through Joburg's night city, particularly as a young woman, has meant adopting particular protective sensibilities. But it has also opened up alternate ways of knowing and encountering the city and its practices.lBeth Vale is post-doctoral fellow at the University of the Witwatersrand.
