 Willy Masango and Shagashe Chiloane created a new genre they call ubuntu music. The two were born in KwaNdebele, Mpumalanga."We call it ubuntu music because it uses more African elements like ululating, chanting voices and drums that are different from the ones used in the mainstream music," Chiloane, 28, said, adding their aim was to make sure South Africans knew their roots."The genre intends to reinstall an ubuntu element that has disappeared in the long run due to obstacles such as discrimination, oppression and racism in the country."Ndebele Movement was formed in 2014 and released their first album Ndebele Afrikha late last year.He said that they faced the challenge of getting their music airplay because of language. "This includes Inkwenkwezi FM, a station that's supposed to promote Ndebele language. They hardly play the music with Ndebele content."The album is on iTunes and Ndebele Movement takes orders through social media.The duo wants to grow the genre. "We would like to have an ubuntu music category on the popular musical awards."
