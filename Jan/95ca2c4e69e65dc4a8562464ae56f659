 Bonolo Nthompe, also from the sprawling township, said she was shown the door by bouncers at Imbizo-Busy Corner on Friday last week.Nthompe, 24, said the incident happened hours after she and her friends had arrived at the popular tourist joint."We arrived there at 5pm. Then at about midnight I was violently thrown out because of the dress I was wearing," she said.She said the eviction followed an argument they had with patrons sitting next to them."We informed Vusi, the floor manager, about the verbal abuse coming from people sitting next to us. He told us that he would tell the securities to keep an eye on the guys who were abusing us."The abuse continued and all of a sudden I was grabbed by security guards and pushed outside like a slut in full view of other customers."It happened so fast. I was dancing and the next thing I'm being shoved out," she said.The instruction to evict her came from another manager known as Samkeliso, she said."Samkeliso told me I was dressed inappropriately and that people could see my panties."Nthompe told Sunday World she had to pay her bill in the rain from outside the premises and then leave."I was so hurt and humiliated. I don't understand why was the length of my dress an issue."I've seen other women wearing only T-shirts there but they never got thrown out," she said.Managing director of the joint, Senzo Mhlongo, said they have a policy governing the dress code for their customers.He could not elaborate further on the policy and how it is communicated to their customers."When patrons refuse to comply, we ensure that our female security escort them outside," he said.Mhlongo said it was not the first time that they kicked out a customer for wearing a mini- skirt or short dresses.He said in the case of Nthompe, they will view CCTV footage, conduct an internal investigation and communicate the feedback to her.
