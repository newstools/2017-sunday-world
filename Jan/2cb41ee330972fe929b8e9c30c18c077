"I've performed with her... I've even cried with her. I will miss her."The funeral saw everybody, from musicians and government officials to ordinary people, filling up the DJ Thomas Hall in Alberton.Klaasen's children, family members, friends and officials took to the podium to praise the jazz great for her contribution to the country through her music.The stalwart was laid to rest at the heroes' acre at the Thomas Nkobi Memorial Park in Boksburg.Her daughter Lorraine held her mother's framed photograph throughout the proceedings at the cemetery.Before the coffin was lowered, she led a choir of family members who sang a tribute to Klaasen, saying, 'Goodbye Sis'Thandi, now it's time to go, we hate to leave you but you really must go'."As the coffin went down most family members put on a brave face, but as it sank lower and disappeared from the surface, Lorraine struggled to hold back the tears and eventually cried aloud.Following the burial, a memorial stone was unveiled and for the first time, Lorraine and her brother Roger Phambane managed a smile as the sculpture of the music icon was revealed.Fellow singer Dorothy Masuka said they shared many fond memories."We are going to miss our sister so much," she said.Sipho "Hostix" Mabuse said Klaasen was a friend of his mother's."Sis'Thandi was close to me, I have known her my whole life. I've performed with her, backed her as a young musician. I've even cried with her. I will miss her dearly."He told Sunday World that it hurt him that she was no more, but knowing that she had gone to rest and was no longer in pain comforted him.Legendary singer Blondie Makhene said Klaasen was "the rock that crushed the lack of confidence and cowardice" in him."When I was growing up I was reserved because of the [type of ] society I grew up in, but when I met Sis'Thandi, my whole life changed."I became the crazy person you see now after hiding my true self. She told me to be myself," he said.Klaasen died at the age of 86 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
