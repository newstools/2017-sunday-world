"Congregants who are alleged to have been involved (in the assault) are known to the church"Reverend Abbey Wessie, a senior preacher and chairman of the church's executive committee, was allegedly moered by angry congregants for trying to boot them out of the church premises in the Letlhabile, Brits, parish.A church insider this week showed Sunday World pictures of a badly-bruised and swollen Wessie.The church member, who asked not to be named for fear of victimisation, said the alleged assault took place on December 21 when Wessie brought security guards to chuck out members he accused of belonging to a certain faction within the church.IPHC, South Africa's second-biggest church with more than 3.5-million members, has been torn by a deadly leadership battle since its leader Bishop Glayton Modise died in February last year.Modise's son, Tshepiso, has been barred from taking over from his father through legal and violent means.At the time of his death Modise was married to two wives - Mirriam Modise and Pearl Tafu. They have been at each other's throats since he died, fighting most of their battles through the courts.The source said: "He told a group of about 40 church congregants that they were not welcome to worship inside the church. The congregants refused to leave the premises, overpowered Wessie's security guards and assaulted him."However, Wessie denies that he was manhandled by church members but said he had fallen victim to a robbery which occurred outside the premises."Whoever told you this is lying. I was mugged outside the church. I don't know anything about bringing security guards to the church and telling people to leave."Yes I was at the church on the day but left unharmed," Wessie said.IPHC spokesman Freddie Ramaphakela confirmed that violence took place."About Rev Wessie being beaten up by congregants we would like to give the investigating officer space to complete the investigation. Congregants who are alleged to have been involved are known to the church," Ramaphakela said.He also confirmed that two vehicles were taken during the incident. "The impounding of two cars is not denied but the identity of the owner is not for public knowledge as the owner was not at the scene."About injuries, we haven't yet met Rev Wessie or seen his medical report."We all hope it is the last (violent incident) and wish that ultimately justice prevails in all incidences that occurred in our church and carries criminal elements," he said.Police spokesman Sabata Mokgwabone said two cases had been opened."Letlhabile police are investigating a case of malicious damage to property and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm."Two suspects were arrested and appeared at the Brits Magistrate's Court on December 23. They were granted bail," Mokgwabone said.February 9 2016: IPHC Bishop Glayton Modise dies after a battle with diabetes.
