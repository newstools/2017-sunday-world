 Sihle Bolani took her beef with the ruling party to court and demanded that its president Jacob Zuma order his organisation to settle the debt.Also embroiled in the drama are minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, party secretary general Gwede Mantashe, former Gauteng MEC of transport Ignatius Jacobs and ANC activist Shaka Sisulu, whom the public relations company owner accuses of failing to pay what's due to her.In her multimillion-rand lawsuit against the party, Bolani also made sensational claims of corruption, saying some party officials demanded bribes from her.The well-known socialite accused Jacobs and his colleague Joseph Nkadimeng of demanding kickbacks of about R800000 if she wanted her invoice to be prioritised for payment."On November 1 2016, Mr Nkadimeng advised me that I am required to pay back R800000. The R800000 would be for the personal use of Mr Nkadimeng, Mr Jacobs and a Mr Paul Langa," she said.Bolani, owner of Sihle Bolani Communications, stated in court documents seen by Sunday World that after several meetings to demand payment, she agreed "out of desperation" to a settlement fee of R1-million, which she expected to be paid in full.However, she said the ANC failed to honour that agreement. She has, therefore, asked the court to cancel that settlement agreement.Bolani said after a long struggle to get payment, the organisation promised that R500000 would be paid in December while they looked for funds to settle the balance.Payment was never made.She said on December 30 she received a call from a Neville Naidoo who told her that the party was able to arrange payment of R100000 which would be paid by one of their sponsors.She said on January 2 2017, Naidoo asked that she submit a new invoice for R100000 and that the invoice was to be addressed to Mr Tseki Nkadimeng of AfricOil.But still no payment was made, she says.According to court documents, Bolani was roped in as a project manager to assist the ANC's marketing team during the local government elections in which the organisation lost three metros, namely Joburg, Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay." ... A meeting took place at the Ogilvy offices in Bryanston were Joseph Nkadimeng and Shaka Sisulu, representatives of the 1st respondent tasked to put together a marketing team for the municipal elections, briefed myself and other members of their team about the elections project and the 1st respondent's requirements."She said after being made to run around for her money, she sought Radebe's intervention."He promised to look into it and get the party to pay, but still that didn't work out," she said.Bolani said she was called to meetings at the party's headquarters in the Joburg CBD to discuss payment. She said some meetings were cancelled at the last minute.Justifying why the matter should be heard on an urgent basis, Bolani said her company, family and families of her employees, were heavily affected by the party's non-payment.She said after she sent a letter of demand to the party, Mantashe responded."The African National Congress does not own a company called Black Carbon, nor does it have any shares therein,"Mantashe wrote back to her, according to the court documents.She said although she received the R100000 as promised, the ANC has not complied with its obligations in terms of the settlement agreement.ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said the ANC was not aware of the urgent application but indicated that if the matter was to go to court, the party would defend itself."The ANC's communications unit has never appointed any Joseph Nkadimeng to represent the ANC and we have never appointed any company called Sihle Bolani Communications during the local government elections campaign," said Kodwa.Speaking about Mantashe's response to Bolani's letter of demand, Kodwa said: "The SG was right because the ANC has never mandated anyone to represent the organisation and the ANC has no knowledge of any Joseph Nkadimeng."
