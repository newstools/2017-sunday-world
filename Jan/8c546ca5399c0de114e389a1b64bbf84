 Well, Brenden got married to sweetheart Mpho on Saturday in what appears to be a small and intimate ceremony attended by their close friends and relatives.The blushing bride looked pretty in an off-white embroidered gown, while the groom suited up in blue.Mpho also took to Instagram, after the wedding, to jot down a love letter to her newly-minted husband:You came into my life and everything changed. All you see is the best in me. All you do is love me. All you do is sacrifice for me.When love is pure, age is not a factor, material is not a factor. All of a sudden a huge wedding, a perfect white dress, all the glits and glam no longer mattered. I just wanted to become one with my soul mate. Only family and close friends as witnesses, simplicity at its best not overpowering the true meaning of what yesterday was. Nobody understood what we were doing but when everybody left they left with what we had prayed for.Our love inspires. Our love rejuvenates. Our life changes lives. Our love is not picture perfect, our love is purpose. I don't know what this journey holds, but I know who holds the journey. I know God didn't bring us together for us, but for a much greater purpose. Thank you for making me your wife. Ngiyakuthanda Ledwaba Malatjie, Tlou le Tebele..... Call me Mrs Ledwaba.The couple got engaged just a month ago in December.
