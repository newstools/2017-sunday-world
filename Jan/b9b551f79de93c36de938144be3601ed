 Gugulethu Mbatha allegedly overdosed on pills in November after suffering depression as a result of problems at work.According to her mother, Thembi, her problems started after she was suddenly moved from Molefe's office in March."My daughter loved her job, she was always working hard but things took a turn after she was removed from Molefe's office," she said.The mother said her daughter was forced to take three weeks of leave before her "demotion" after she could not locate Molefe's passport before an important overseas trip.Gugulethu had turned their offices upside-down for days looking for the passport without any luck, her mother said.As a result, Molefe could not travel and the passport was later found in her drawer by another employee.Thembi said a day before she was scheduled to return to work, Gugulethu got a message instructing her to report to the human resources department when she returned."She was told that Mr Molefe did not want to work with her anymore because he did not trust her," said Thembi.She said after the demotion her daughter got depressed and began skipping work on many occasions."It got to the point where she admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital."Eskom led my daughter into committing suicide. I have a feeling the passport saga was a plot to remove her from Molefe's office. If they didn't want her, why did they not give her a package and retrench her?" asked Thembi.Gugulethu died in her Midrand, Joburg, apartment on November 16. She is survived by two children, her husband, mother and siblings.Police spokesperson Matome Tlamela said police were called to the scene and an inquest docket was opened.Eskom said it could not divulge confidential information about its employees .Molefe could not be reached for comment.khalianyanel@sundayworld.co.za
