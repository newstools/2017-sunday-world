 Senong gave Harriet Ramaswiela the boot after he discovered that she had been allegedly playing for other teams while he was away on national duty.Speaking to Sunday World this week, Ramaswiela confirmed that she was now staying at her parents' home in Pimville, Soweto."I'm still married to him and I still have the keys to the house. The thing is I have never cheated on anyone. I have never cheated," she said.She refused to discuss their troubled marital affairs further. "I won't say anything further," Ramaswiela said.A family friend informed Sunday World that Senong showed his wife the door last month. "He kicked her out of their house in Ormonde on December 17 and she has been living in Soweto ever since."Thabo told his wife to leave her job about seven months ago because he was making enough money in soccer. He knows his wife depends on him financially but she has been struggling since she was thrown out of the house," said the family friend, who asked not to be named."He only gives the money to his own mother who then takes the money to the wife's family. He is no longer supporting the wife financially despite having encouraged her to stop working so she could become a house wife," said the friend.Before leaving her job, Ramaswiela was working in the beauty industry.The friend alleged that some of Senong's family members were spying on Ramaswiela while the coach was away with Bafana Bafana."Someone in the family snitched on Harriet. They followed her car around wherever she went. They are the ones who claim that Harriet is cheating on Thabo. They claim that she had been seeing a particular man for the past three years," said the source.Senong, an award-winning coach, declined to comment.
