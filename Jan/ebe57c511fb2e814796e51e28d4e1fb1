 Speaking to TshisaLIVE on Thursday Kay confirmed that he will be absent from Uzalo for a while but said that he is still very much a part of the production. I m not leaving the show the issue is a logistical one. I ve decided to move to Johannesburg to further my personal interests but the show requires that its cast film in KwaZulu-Natal. That means that my character will be off-screen for a short time while we discuss whether I can film in Johannesburg Kay said.Kay who plays the role of Ayanda Mdletshe said that he met with the show s producers late last year to discuss his move and that he was positive that the two parties would be able to come up with a solution.Kay s situation is a difficult one and the actor admitted that it could see him lose his job.Still if he was to be cut from the show he said that it would be a risk that he is willing to take. I know how this industry works and that I could wake up one day and find that I no longer have a job (at Uzalo) but it s a risk I am willing to take to further my career Kay said.Attempts to contact Uzalo s management for comment on Kay s future were unsuccessful.Kay s comments come after a recent report by Drum claimed that Kay had decided to leave the show because he was overworked and underpaid .Kay denied this and said that he worked as hard as any other actor on the show and did not hold any grudges with the show s producers about his work hours or pay. There is no bad blood or beef between me and the show s producers. I keep in contact with them and recently attended a funeral for one of my Uzalo colleagues. So we have a good relationship Kay said.He said that he was looking forward to taking on fresh challenges in Johannesburg and has scouted out several opportunities but had not yet committed to any new projects.
