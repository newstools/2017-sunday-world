 Sjava, born Jabulani Hadebe, relaunched his music career after a four-year break with a track called Ekseni and followed it up with his debut album, Isina Muva.The Bergville, KZN-born rapper unleashed a second single called Uthando and ruled the airwaves for most of last year.Sjava's music style has also earned him a comparison with kwaito star and rapper Zola7, mostly for his Zulu raps skills.However, Sjava said he was not overwhelmed by his success."I still have a long way to go. But so far I'm happy with the reception my music is getting. What I learnt from the decision is that I wasted my time on acting," he said.The rapper started his acting career on Zone 14, an SABC1 drama. Reflecting on how he got the part, Sjava said he had gone to Bomb Productions offices to drop off his music hoping to get them to play it as a soundtrack in the drama. However, while there, producers asked him to audition for a role."I took the chance because I thought it would help me popularise my music and to push my brand."After that he moved to Generations where he played the character of Pule, a drug dealer.The hip-hop star was also featured on 7de Laan, an Afrikaans soapie on SABC2.
