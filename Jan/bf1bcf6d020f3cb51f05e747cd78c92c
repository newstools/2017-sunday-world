 Dolly supposedly concluded talks with Montpellier last week and certain reports claimed he was to fly to France earlier this week, but Sundowns maintained yesterday they were awaiting for the Ligue 1 club to comply with financial obligations."He will be released only when clause two of his contract has been met," said Sundowns general manager Sizwe Nzimande yesterday. That clause states that the 24-year-old midfielder may leave only once "full payment has been received".Nzimande was confident Montpellier had transferred the required 1.7-million (about R25-million) buyout fee."[Montpellier] told us they transferred the money. But it has yet to show on our side. We expect it to show any time from now. There's no crisis at all. As soon as we receive confirmation of payment, we will issue Dolly with a clearance and he can join them."It's unclear why the funds were taking so long to reflect in Sundowns' account. But Nzimande pointed out that the transfer window period still has a few more days to go, closing on Tuesday evening."We are not worried at all because [Montpellier] know what has to happen."Dolly, however, has already bid goodbye to his teammates. He also responded to a farewell message from Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana on social media last week, telling him: "I'm gonna miss you so much my captain, especially beating you at Fifa."
