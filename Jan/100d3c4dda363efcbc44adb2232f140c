 After Dlamini resigned last October as co-host of the Monday night soccer show, many fans were left guessing who would take up the reins.Dlamini, who is also a former girlfriend of Khune's, was immediately replaced - although on an interim basis, by SABC sports broadcaster Vaylen Kirtley.SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said: "I don't know anything about that. As far as I know, Minnie resigned and an announcement will be made when a replacement has been found".However, two sources close to the situation at the SABC said that Mpisane was being "groomed" to take over as the next co-presenter. She is earmarked to join long-time sports anchor Thomas Mlambo."It is true that she will be joining the show," said a senior sports producer at SABC. "That information started filtering through in November last year, and I heard now in January that she is being trained to get ready to take over."I understand that her parents are friends with one of the group executives," the producer said.Another senior SABC staffer said the move was hypocritical. "Minnie was fired because they said she had no knowledge of soccer. Now they are bringing another presenter who also knows nothing about soccer. That's unfair."Xoli Zondo was discovered from a talent search show, which was a fair process. Why not give her the opportunity?" asked the staffer.Mpisane, whose parents Shauwn and S'bu are Durban-based tenderpreneurs, did not want to comment.When contacted, Mpisane hung up the phone immediately after hearing what it was about. "Yes, what, no," she said, before hanging up.She split from Khune in July last year and announced on social media: "Not everything works out the way you wish for it to do... some situations are worth removing yourself away from . I am no longer dating the Kaizer Chiefs Bafana Bafana goalkeeper anymore sadly."
