It s a day wedding and the first part of the wedding is in the amphitheatre. There is a private entrance that guests will be using said a source.Insiders have told us that security for the wedding is expected to be very tight as guests will need to provide proof of invite and there is speculation that mobile phones may be banned.TshisaLIVE can also reveal that actress Sophie Ndaba who owns a wedding company was hired as the planner for the event. Enhle who is a big supporter of designer Gert-Johan Coetzee has enlisted his services to create a dress for the occassion.Last year DJ Fresh confirmed that he has received an invite and would be attending.
