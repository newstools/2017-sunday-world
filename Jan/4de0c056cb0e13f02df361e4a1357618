"She must drop the case because what she says Mbuso does not do, I have been doing"Unlike his late granddad who spent 27 years in jail to fight for freedom, he was nabbed for allegedly failing to maintain his minor child.After spending the better part of his festive holidays in Cape Town and failing to appear at the Johannesburg Family Court in December for papgeld, a warrant of his arrest was issued.Norwood police station officers picked him up from his grandfather's mansion in Houghton, north of Joburg, last Friday and frog-marched him to court.His baby mama, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claims that Mbuso blew R4-million of his inheritance and failed to set anything aside for his sprog.Mbuso was awarded R4-million by his grandpa, who died in 2013.The woman told Sunday World that despite the windfall, Mbuso continued to give her a run-around and instead his brother Ndaba was the one helping her financially."I was forced to go to court to get him to support his child since he got his inheritance money. But still he does not want to contribute anything."I received a call from Mbuso's older brother Ndaba telling me Mbuso was arrested."He asked me if the arrest had to do with my case and I told him the court had issued a warrant for his arrest, but the police had not told me that they arrested him."All I know is that they have been looking for him since December and have been to his house countless times looking for him," she said.Ndaba confirmed his younger brother was arrested but was surprised about the move because he had been paying papgeld on Mbuso's behalf."She must drop the case because what she says Mbuso does not do, I have been doing it for him. I'm paying that woman R4 000 every month for the child, and there's no need for her to go ahead with the case," said Ndaba.Asked why Mbuso was failing to pay the money despite cashing in on his inheritance, Ndaba fumed: "Did she see the money physically? She must appreciate we are supporting her child."Police spokesman Kay Makhubela confirmed Mbuso was behind bars.
