 The 26-year-old former SA and WBF International, SA, IBO International and WBA Pan African and IBO lightweight holder, was crowned at a function at the Durban's ICC on Friday night.The dexterous boxer from Duncan Village in the Eastern Cape - who can single handedly fill any venue back home in East London to capacity - is trained in Johannesburg by Colin Nathan.Ndongeni said: "This is big. We have not had these awards since 2011, and I am excited to be the first boxer to win the Boxer of the Year award when the awards were returned."Nkosinathi "Mabere" Joyi from Mdantsane won this trophy in 2011."I want to thank my grandmother for raising me. I am still growing as a fighter. It is just that I met the right people early in my life - promoters Mzimasi Mnguni, Ayanda Matiti, Andile Sidinile and Rodney Berman," said Ndongeni, who also paid tribute to his former trainer Mzamo "Chief" Njekanye."You made me what I am today. I also want to thank Warren Joubert (SA junior welterweight champion) and my other stable mates at HotBox."Bukiwe "Anaconda" Nonina from Dutywa, also in Eastern Cape, was deservedly voted Female Boxer of the Year.She is the first female boxer in the country to claim the outright ownership of Boxing SA's championship belt.That was because the boxer, whose skills are honed in Venda, Limpopo, by Immanuel Neluonde, defended her bantamweight belt five times. That is the required number of defences that enables any local champion to own BSA's belt.
