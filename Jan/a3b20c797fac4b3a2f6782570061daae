 Nzimande, who owns and runs record label Zuz'muz Music, said he last saw Tyamara at late gospel singer S'fiso Ncwane's funeral in December, where they agreed on a meeting. However, their plans fell through when Tyamara was admitted to Edenvale Hospital in Joburg."We had planned to see each other to talk about his career but after he was admitted in hospital, a lady called Thobeka called me and told me that Lundi's family say I should not bother to visit him at the hospital as I was not welcome."Nzimande, who worked with Tyamara until 2013, claimed the family said he wanted fame through him."I don't understand how can I do that if I'm the one who discovered Lundi. This is a sad situation. How can I seek fame from someone's sickness?"I used to take Tyamara for check-ups when we were still working together."When he was admitted to Charlotte Maxeke Hospital previously, I asked his sister to call me if they needed anything. Babalwa never got back to me since that day. I just started hearing rumours that I'm not wanted," said Nzimande.Efforts to contact Tyamara's family failed.Meanwhile, Tyamara's road to recovery was paved with prayers on Friday when popular prophet Paseka "Mboro" Motsoeneng paid him a visit.Mboro, who zipped in with his new BMW i8 and accompanied by bodyguards, was ushered into the hospital by some of Tyamara's relatives.The media were barred from entering his ward.
