 The oddly-titled show was announced by the SABC at a press event in Johannesburg on Wednesday and will see Tumi team up with fellow comedian Alan Committee.As the name suggests the show has very little to do with cooking and something to do with the delicious red cake dessert. It s called red cake because the show has a little bit of everything. It is a game show a features show a comedy show and a talk show. Really it has everything in it just like one of those red cakes you would get in the township which is made up of a lot of different cakes Tumi told TshisaLIVE on Thursday.The show will see Tumi challenge local celebrities to traditional games before interviewing and featuring them.Tumi who has previous hosted Mzansi Magic s popular reality show Our Perfect Wedding said that she was excited about her TV return. I m really excited to be part of such a great show. I was of course nervous at first but its a light-hearted show so I think that it will go well added Tumi.
