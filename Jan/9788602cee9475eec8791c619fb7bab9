 The deep house music DJ, real named Dumisani Ncuthe, was subjected to social media mockery due to the low turnout.The poor attendance at the event prompted artists such as Emtee, Bucie and DJ Ganyani to cancel their scheduled performances at the event.Nine months later, Ncuthe is having the last laugh because the very same album -Mmthi's Essential Selections 7 - has been nominated for a Metro FM award in the Best Compilation category. He is up against DJ Fresh and DJ Qnes, both of whom he described as strong contenders."I am very excited and feel honoured to be nominated. I deserve the nomination because people appreciate my comeback and love my music."Hard work pays. This shows that when you are focused on what you are doing you stand to achieve things," he said.Speaking of his launch, he said he did not see it as a failure because there was nothing he could do about the bad weather."No matter how much I would have loved to change the situation, it was just a coincidence that it rained on the day," he said.He told Sunday World that the launch did not affect the sales of the album. "The album was well received and is doing well," he said.Ncuthe said he lost a lot of money but walked away with lessons he would implement in future.He said he wished those who were mocking him to live longer so they could witness his success because he has more coming.According to Ncuthe, he will be launching Mmthi's Essential Selections 8 next year in a similar but better way."I will launch it the same way, but this time I will do a tour around the country building up to the big launch."It will happen at FNB Stadium as well."We are not aiming to fill it up. We just want to create an awareness about this album," Ncuthe added.
