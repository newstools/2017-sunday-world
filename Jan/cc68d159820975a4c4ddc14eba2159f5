So don t be choosy when in comes to your sins. Go write your own Bible she said.Despite the backlash she got on social media Zahara told TshisaLIVE that her comments had nothing to do with Somizi and the debacle.

I am currently on holiday at my village in the Eastern Cape and didn t even know about Somizi walking out of the church she said.Zahara added that her comments were not directed to anyone. I don t care whether you re gay or not. I just made a statement. I am a church person and I just wanted to tell people that when you go to church don t be stupid she added.The singer added that she was not fazed by the hate. I don t even read people s comments on social media because I know there will always be hate whenever I say anything she said.Zahara s comments came just days after the Idols SA judge blasted Grace Bible Church for a homophobic sermon delivered on Sunday.
