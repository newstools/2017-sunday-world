 News that his song Van Damme was voted SABC Summer Song of the Year shocked many people.The maskandi song cruised through to the top, overtaking the anticipated winners Wololo and Ska Bhora Moreki.But just who is this sudden phenomenon?His real name is Sthembiso Fakude and he is 31 years old.He has made history as the first maskandi musician to win the public vote.Van Damme first took off in KwaZulu-Natal where it was picked up by Ukhozi FM and was played on heavy rotation.Fakude says it's a motivational song, referring to the iconic 90s martial arts film star Jean-Claude Van Damme."This song is about motivating people to say whatever challenge you face, you must have a never-die attitude, like how Van Damme never dies in all his movies," he said.Fakude could not contain his excitement after he was told his song had emerged victorious."I was so excited! I did not even know what to do with myself," he said.Fakude grew up herding cattle in Mkuze, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, where he was born."I was very young and I would play the guitar while in the field looking after cattle," he said.He moved to Joburg in 2007 to pursue his music dream . He says he played his demo and sold his music on the streets too, which led to him being discovered by Izingane Zoma's Shobeni Khuzwayo.He later signed with Mabala Noise when the company launched last year."I always had a dream, and now it's coming true," Fakude said.He describes himself as a shy person who loves his family and loves having a good time.
