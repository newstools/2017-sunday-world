 French Ligue 1 outfit Montpellier are prepared to meet the player's buyout clause which has been set at ?1.7-million (R24 million) and will submit an offer any day now.Despite media reports suggesting Montpellier have met Dolly's buyout clause, Sundowns revealed that they had not received a formal offer from Montpellier by the time of going to print yesterday.Dolly, however, bid farewell to his Sundowns teammates at Chloorkop yesterday, a clear sign that he expects the deal to go through. The 23-year-old is expected to fly out to France today or tomorrow, according to a source, to discuss personal terms and have a medical.Sundowns are set to make a huge profit on the money they spent to bring the talented winger from Ajax Cape Town to Chloorkop.He was signed for R6-million, and they stand to make an R18-million profit, triple the amount they forked out for his services.Sundowns president Patrice Motsepe had previously warned European clubs wanting to sign Dolly not to "disrespect" the club by offering to pay the fee in installments, but it's clear Montpellier are keen to have the player, who turns 24 on Sunday, on board.Under the guidance of coach Pitso Mosimane, Dolly's game has matured, and he has become one of the best players in the PSL.His work-rate has also improved, while his finishing in front of goal keeps getting better.Mosimane, however, felt Dolly needed one more season in the PSL to improve on a few areas of his game, as was the case with now Portugal-based Bongani Zungu.Montpellier are currently in 13th place in the French Ligue 1, just five points ahead of bottom of the table side Metz.Dolly's agent Paul Mitchell said: "What you have read in the media is probably correct, but we are not giving any comments at the moment. We are concentrating on getting his move done. We'll comment once everything is done."
