 The Roll Up rapper took to social media this past weekend to upload a video and a snap of himself getting a cross tattoo underneath his left eye.Emtee s decision drew debate on his social media pages with some fans congratulating him on his tattoo while others lambasted him for his stupidity .The usually outspoken rapper chose not engage some of his trolls but told TshisaLIVE that he was not fazed by some of the hate he got. To be honest I expected people to hate it and for there to be backlash. But it s my face I can do what I like with it. It s my money and I can spend it on whatever I want Emtee said.He explained that the tattoo was a spontaneous decision and that he decided on a cross because of his belief in God. I decided on the spot and when they asked me what I wanted I knew that it had to be a cross because of my faith. I carry my belief with me on a daily basis and so why not have it on my face? Emtee added.Face tattoos have long been a popular accessory for US rappers including Lil Wayne The Game and Wiz Khalifa and Emtee admitted that he was following in their footsteps. Of course I m inspired by US rappers especially those that rap similar to me. I am not trying to copy them but I am inspired by them Emtee said.
