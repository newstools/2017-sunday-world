 Take for example Cameron "Kangaroo" Adams from Westbury.The skinny former Transvaal middleweight champion is said to have stunned the gallery in court when he allegedly told a judge "it does not matter what happens to me. I will remain the champ."The man - known to others as "The Champ" - had been asked if there was anything he wanted to say before being sentenced. Adams had been found guilty of murder.He was expected to plead for a lighter sentence. Adams was executed in the 1980s.He was a gang member of the Spaldings. Gangsterism in Westbury spoiled what could have been a wonderful breeding ground for boxing champions.There were great boxing trainers from most coloured communities. They knew exactly what they were doing, but their hard work and future prospects of their charges were cut short by gangsterism.Today there are no fewer than five professional boxers from coloured communities.It is unclear if there will ever be similar fearless boxers like Adams, Desmond "Twakkies" Stuurman, Richard Borias, Aladin Stevens, Peter Faver, Wayne Martin and Rodwell Lekey. They were tough.Some said the gang wars began with a game of hitting each other with cardboard, which led to fist fights and the fist fights turned into knife fights and later gunfights.Fights would break out at dance halls on Friday nights and it would spill over on to the football fields.What happened was unfortunate because boxing careers were brought to an abrupt end.
