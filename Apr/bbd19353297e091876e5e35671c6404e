 SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago confirmed to TshisaLIVE that Khanyi Mbau would get her own show while Lerato Kganyago teamed up with Bonang Matheba on The Front Row as co-host.The news comes just hours after DJ Fresh took over the reins as the breakfast show host and was joined by Somizi Mhlongo as his co-host.Kaizer said that the changes on the radio station weren t new and happened every year. I know the word reshuffle is a good word to use as with the current news in our country but the changes on Metro are no surprise. They are changes we effect for a new financial year the only difference is we have not shared them publicly as we usually do he said.Kaizer added that it was their strategy to surprise listeners with the changes and was therefore coy to reveal much detail about future plans. You need to listen to the Metro that s how you will know what is going on. That is our strategy to keep our listeners engaged he said.Khanyi also declined to comment on her new show. Till I get confirmation I am not allowed to comment on Metro or have anything to do with the media Khanyi said.The changes come in the wake of Glen Lewis resignation from the station to join Touch HD. This was followed by Unathi Msengana s shock departure on Friday after a decade on the station.
