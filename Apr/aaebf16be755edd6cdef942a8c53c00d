 Sundowns's barren run was stretched to four matches after their 2-1 defeat to Kaizer Chiefs at the weekend.Feutmba, however, feels there's no reason to panic."They are still favourites. I believe they will close the gap. This is normal. You can't be on top form all the time. There are times when you are going to go through a slump. Players can get tired, not just physically, but mentally too. They need to minimise some of the mistakes and I think they will be fine," said the legendary midfielder, who is currently working in the ABC Motsepe League with Mphakathi Academy.He added: "[Denis] Onyango was injured, Khama [Billiat] was injured, so it becomes difficult. Even though football is a team sport, there are players who make a difference."At a time like this, Sundowns need to stay as a unit to ensure their title chances do not diminish, he urged."It's just that most people expect them to win every game because they come from very good form. They just have to regroup and make sure they focus on what they want to achieve. Everyone has to stick together and work as a unit."Fifth-placed Sundowns face Bloemfontein Celtic at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm).Celtic beat Sundowns 3-1 in this fixture last season and 5-0 the campaign before that.The visitors will no doubt fancy their chances of winning again in Atteridgeville.
