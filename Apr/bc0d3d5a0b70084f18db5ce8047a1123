 Mkangisa, 29, will be playing the character of Tshepiso Ndlovu, a young trophy wife who becomes a widow."After her husband's death she finds herself having to take over his business," said Mkangisa."Tshepiso gets a rude awakening when she discovers that the business was illegal and that he had been lying to her all his life."After her hubby died, she has to find herself and she realises she was too dependent on him. Despite all that, she wants to make her hubby proud and hold on to his legacy. She fights for her place among her new business partners."The partners in the business are Celia played by former Scandal! actress Masasa Mbangeni and Clementine, to be depicted by Vatiswa Ndara, a favourite on Igazi.All three are widows who had to take over after their husbands were brutally murdered.Mkangisa said the character is different from all the roles she has played before."This is a woman who fights to get what she wants. She was forced by circumstances to grow and stopped seeing things for what they seem to be," she said.She said viewers can expect a gripping storyline with strong female lead actresses.Mkangisa said she grew up as a shy girl, but it all changed when she went to the Rand Show at the age of 14, and saw YoTV presenters in action."I thought what they were doing was cool and would not mind doing it. I shortly went for auditions and was the overall winner."I don't know what happens to my shyness once I am in front of a camera. I blossom and show my other side," she said.Harvest premieres on Monday, May 1, at 9.30pm.
