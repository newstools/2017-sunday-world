 The "Citizens" have not lost to any of the PSL's top five in the league and, according to football analyst Siyabonga Nkosi, City are more than capable of winning the title.Nkosi, who played for current title chasers Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United at the pinnacle of his career, said power has shifted this season and City are doing their best to upset the big boys."When I saw that this fixture was coming up, my first thought was that if they beat Bidvest Wits [tonight at Cape Town Stadium, 7.30pm] it will be a strong statement to say they are genuine contenders for the league title," Nkosi, a pundit for pay-channel SuperSport, told Sowetan yesterday."It's not really a decider, but it will be a solid statement from Cape Town City. They've signalled their intentions with their performances."City have already beaten Wits in the league this season. They won 3-2 away from home in early December and Nkosi expects another tight clash."It'll be decided by very small margins," he said.City probably didn't expect to be where they are at the start of the season, but Nkosi said they are just as much under pressure as the other title contenders."They might lose out or win it, but the good thing is they've given it a go. Well, they are certainly more under scrutiny now because they have won the [2016] Telkom Knockout."City winger Aubrey Ngoma warned: "We can't get ahead of ourselves. We want to remain calm and take it one game at a time. We can talk about winning the league if we are still on top with two or three games to go. We don't want to put ourselves under unnecessary pressure."
