If he is bold enough he should call me and say all these things to my face," said MarawaShebeleza, real name Victor Bogopane, was speaking on the sidelines of Motsoeneng's marathon press conference on Wednesday.The Ebumnandini hitmaker said he was concerned by the trio's no-show at the former SABC COO's media briefing while they "benefitted the most from Motsoeneng's interventions" when he was at the helm."They are nowhere to be found, but we all benefited from Hlaudi and it was important for us to show our appreciation for what he has done for us," said Shebeleza.He claimed Marawa would have long been fired at the SABC "but Hlaudi saved him several times"."Bonang was also rescued by Hlaudi when she had problems at the SABC but where is she today? Arthur today has a platform on SABC, thanks to Hlaudi, ... but they are not here. They are all sellouts."I'm not fighting with the three, I'm just reminding them of the role Motsoeneng played in their careers for them to be where they are today," he said.Marawa dismissed Shebeleza's accusations as "nonsense". "He is talking nonsense. He does not understand my relationship with Hlaudi and if he is bold enough he should call me and say all that to my face," said Marawa.Mafokate refused to comment.Matheba's manager Jay Badza said "Ms Matheba is in New York on business and therefore we can't comment on the article."Shebeleza also threw shade at production companies and music legends who received R50000 each from Motsoeneng, saying they too should have been at the presser to show their support."He gave actors three-year contracts and made sure that other actors established their own production companies. I expected them to be here as well," said Shebeleza.Motsoeneng said Shebeleza was "out of order" by calling people who were not at his press conference sellouts."I don't agree with him. Yes I have protected Marawa and Bonang but them not coming to my press conference doesn't mean anything," he said.Motsoeneng said he does not doubt Marawa and Matheba's support.
