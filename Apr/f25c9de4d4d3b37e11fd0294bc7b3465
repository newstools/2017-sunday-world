"He was like a brother and family member to us "At that time, Tshabalala was Durandt's assistant.The Tshabalala brothers are from Free State, where Durandt, 53, died on Friday afternoon.He was involved in an accident while riding his motor bike on the R712 between Clarens and Bethlehem.It is understood that Durandt - who retired as a boxing trainer last year after 30 years and handed over the reins to his son Damien - collided with a vehicle.When Durandt retired from boxing, he joined the Crusaders Bike Club and was later appointed as its president.Tshabalala, who parted ways with Durandt after he had been taped making racist comments about black people and Indians, said: "I got a shock of my life when I heard that Nick had died. I just cried. I am still in tears as I am speaking to you."No one understands the relationship my family had with Nick. He was like a brother and family member to us. He knew our parents and he even attended the funeral of Ginger in Free State."Ginger died after being shot at Bree Street taxi rank in Joburg in 1995.Elias and Durandt will be remembered for helping Thulani "Sugar Boy" Malinga from Ladysmith, KZN leave 55 000 English fans in tears after he ended the reign of their idol Nigel Benn as the WBC super-middleweight champion in 1996.Malinga became the first local fighter to win the sought after green and gold WBC belt.President Nelson Mandela later had breakfast with the team for their monumental achievement.Interestingly, Tshabalala guided a supposed washed-up Dingaan "The Rose of Soweto" Thobela to victory for that same belt against another Englishman, Glen Catley in 2000.Boxing SA chairwoman Ntambi Ravele and chief executive Tsholofelo Lejaka - whose organisation honoured Durandt with the Lifetime Achievement Award in Durban in January - said it was hard to believe that the flamboyant mentor was no more."Nick came to me in Kempton Park during a tournament recently and said he was making a comeback," said Ravele. "Little did I know that I was seeing him for the last time."Lejaka said: "A sad moment in the life our boxing community. His accomplishments are unparalleled."Durandt produced 95 SA champions in all 17 weight divisions, more than 30 world champions and 27 international champions.He also assisted with the training and conditioning of American heavyweight boxer Hasim Rahman, who knocked out Lennox Lewis in the fifth round at Carnival City near Brakpan in 2001.Funeral arrangements have not been finalised.
