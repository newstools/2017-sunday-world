 Dlulane, who hung up his boots in 2006 after sustaining a neck injury, told police in Pretoria that he was conned out of his hard-earned cash after responding to a dubious SMS.In his police statement seen by Sunday World this week, Dlulane said he was defrauded after he gave out his banking information to the scammers.Dlulane said he thought the SMS was from the South African Revenue Services (SARS)." I received an SMS which I thought was from SARS. It wanted my banking details for my tax returns," Dlulane said.Dlulane, now a senior team manager at the Blue Bulls, said he believed the SMS was credible because he was expecting his tax returns that month."I was excited to get some of my tax money back, so I did not suspect anything until I realised that money was being transferred out of my account. I immediately notified my bank and subsequently opened a case of fraud."I am disappointed with both the bank and the police because I have not received my money till this day," he said.He said the police told him that there was nothing they could do since the phone number that was used to con him was untraceable.He said he was now cautions of such schemes. "This will never happen again man, now I check every detail before I give out my personal information," he said.Police spokesman Kay Makhubele had not responded at the time going to press.
