 This was a time when men were gentlemen with the finest suits and ladies donned their best swing skirts.While apartheid tried to restrict them, made their lives difficult and devoid of joy, the integrated, mixed-race people of Sophiatown (the legendary black cultural hub township also known as Kofifi) rebelled in the form of Kofifi dance, Kofifi music and other forms of entertainment.And if you've always loved the story of Sophiatown and how it inspired its residents, this is your chance to experience it at The Carousel in Hammanskraal.The Kofifi Movement will recreate the full Sophiatown feel with music, fashion, modes of transport and many more.It'll just be like the snapshots you've seen, only this time you'll be in the picture.If you have never had the privilege to witness the style and times of Sophiatown days, Kofifi Goetes old Skool Sounds and Vintage Fashion events are the place to learn where your maxi dresses, high-waist jeans, crop tops, Afros and skirts originate from.The first event, which was held at The Carousel last Saturday, saw youngsters borrowing from their grandparents' teen days, and even the old folk digging deep behind their cupboards to relive their heydays.Vintage cars, old jazzy tunes of the late Thandi Klaasen, hits from jazz legends Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba, and exuberant clothing items were the highlight of the night.The atmosphere was everything vintage.Organiser Marcus Khalo said the aim of the event was to take the crowd down memory lane."We wanted people to experience the atmosphere of Sophiatown. We wanted the crowd to feel the music, the poetry, [and] the dances while they connect with each other," said Khalo.One of the ladies who came fully dressed like a real Sophiatown ousie, Elisa Mokgabudi, said she felt good reliving the good old days."We are actually tired of listening to youngsters' music. It's events like these that remind us of who we are and where we come from."The next episodes happen in June and late in August.
