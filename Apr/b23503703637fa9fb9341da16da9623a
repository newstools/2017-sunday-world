 The attitude towards playing on the continent seems to have changed in recent years and this is only going to benefit local football, and Bafana Bafana in particular.Mamelodi Sundowns are in the Champions League group stages, while Platinum Stars and SuperSport United have booked themselves a spot in the Confederation Cup. Dikwena coach Cavin Johnson is delighted that South Africa will have representatives in the group stages of both the Champions League and Confederation Cup."It gives the [PSL] teams and the country a bigger pool of players who will have international experience. Whether they are good enough to play for Bafana or not, it will help us [as the country]," said Johnson, whose side overturned a 2-0 deficit to eventually beat AS Tanda of Ivory Coast 5-4 on penalties at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace on Sunday.Benson Shilongo and Robert Ng'ambi's goals forced a penalty shootout after a 2-2- aggregate."We are over the moon to get to the group stages. It's about exposing our club to African football. European and South American scouts may show an interest in the group stages."SuperSport, meanwhile, advanced to the group phase courtesy of a Jeremy Brockie's hat-trick and goals from Thabo Mnyamane and Fagrie Lakay as they demolished Liberia's Barrack Young Controllers 5-0 at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday to progress 6-1 on aggregate.In Egypt, Bidvest Wits were knocked out of the Confederation Cup following a 1-0 aggregate loss to Smouha on Saturday.CAF will conduct the interclub group phase in Cairo next Wednesday.
