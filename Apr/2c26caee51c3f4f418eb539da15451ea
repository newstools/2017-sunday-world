 This time, the war is over the decision by SABC head of sport Sully Motsweni and acting COO Bessie Tugwana to take over control of Marawa's show at Metro FM.As a result of the new directive by the pair, Marawa will now report directly to the head of group sport instead of reporting to the station's manager Sibongile Mtyali as was the protocol previously.The decision has allegedly left Marawa fuming as he believes that management was trying to frustrate him so he would resign.
