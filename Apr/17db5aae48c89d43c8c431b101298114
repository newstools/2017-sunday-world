 His label Palse Homme instead collaborated with Caterpillar SA footwear as the brand debuted its first CAT Autumn Winter 2017 footwear collection in Maboneng Precinct last week."I am also the brand ambassador. But they commissioned me to come up with a Palse collection that'll complement the shoe line. So it was not going to be possible for me to put together a different collection for the official SAFW," he says.He explains that he has been working with the brand and incorporating its show line at all the shows since 2012 - including Paris last year, SA Fashion Week, Durban Fashion, SA Men's Week, and many other shows in Africa.The designer's clothes may not be as dramatic as some of his counterparts, but he always puts up a stellar show.This time it was conceptualised as ART-Industrial.The collection was showcased at an art gallery called Agog, where there was no runway, but a simple yet dramatic installation."The audience gets up-close and personal with the models in the footwear and apparel as they pose like statues. This way people take in more of the feel of the fabrics, the colours and so forth. We decided on the gallery venue to bring to life the art element, incorporating the industrial look and feel by utilising industrial tools as props," says Segapo.The collection moved away from the "Colorado" boot that CAT is often associated with to more street-style high-top sneakers.The show contained star-studded celebrities who posed as models including, Jon Boynton, Solo, Donald, Ashish Gangapersad, Refilwe Modiselle and Liezl Ramos.From distressed shirts to custom-made blazers, dungarees to the classic little black dress, formal waistcoats and pin-striped pants, Segapo portrayed that these shoes can be worn with anything.
