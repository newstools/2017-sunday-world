 Tats gets to witness first-hand the potential love stories unfold and either the rejection or acceptance that the participants get after approaching their crushes on national TV.He spoke to TshisaLIVE about the assumption that he is a love doctor or plays the Dr Phil role to the participants of Uyang thanda na. Look half the time I am just there cringing or looking away because I can relate to some of the situations. But I am really just a glorified match-maker as opposed to a Dr Phil or love doctor he said.The stand-up comedian adds that as much as he gets to encourage the participants and sometimes tell them that they have made the right choice he is not as brave as they are. I am the suffer in silence type so I admire how brave these people are. I can t even laugh at them although I mostly laugh with them because the nerves are real he said.The Uyang thanda Na presenter who has also recently joined the Metro FM Fresh Breakfast team for a spot of comedy every Monday added that he loves being part of a show that tells real stories .He said that part of the reason he thinks people will be hooked is because he knows that people will always relate to stories that involve a crush because everyone has had or has one.
