 The City coach has tried to ease the increasing pressure on the premiership leaders by claiming the club s season-end target is a top-three finish. Top three is the target. We d love to qualify to play in Africa next year he said.City held on to their narrow lead at the summit of the league standings after coming from behind to draw 1-1 with fellow title challengers Bidvest Wits at the Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday night.Tinkler's charges are one point ahead of Wits and two ahead of defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns but both rivals have played two games less as the race to the title enters the final straight.City are also one point ahead of Kaizer Chiefs who have played the same number of games as them. I don t want to put pressure on my players " he said."We now turn our focus to Chiefs and again it goes to the philosophy that we ve had since the beginning of the season we don t play for or plan for any game for a draw."We plan to beat whoever we play and that will remain."But at the same time we have to be thankful for what we have already achieved. The players have been superb sublime actually with what they have achieved so far."And throwing pressure on them by saying we should have won this and that because of the league I don t think would work in our favour."So we rather just focus on the next game. City s original target was just to stay up in the top-flight in their maiden season but that has changed consistently as the club has kept winning.They are now guaranteed a top eight place but are aiming higher.City host Chiefs at the Cape Town stadium next Tuesday and then have five more league matches after that:Maritzburg United (May 1 away)Free State Stars (May 5 home)SuperSport United (May 9 away)Lamontville Golden Arrows (May 17 home)Polokwane City (May 27 away) - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
