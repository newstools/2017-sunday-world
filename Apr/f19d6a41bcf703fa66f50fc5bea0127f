 Mathiba was ordered by the South Gauteng High Court to shut up and remove all the inflammatory tweets about Mahumapelo and his stable.He was also ordered to pay Mahumapelo's legal costs.Mathiba, whose group left Ambitiouz Entertainment in a huff two months ago, tweeted among others that Mahumapelo's record label hired spies to tail and take pictures of them."We know bout em spys (sic) that follow us. Saw two of em taking pictures of us at zone6," he wrote.He also suggested Mahumapelo, whose artists including Emtee and Amanda Black, won several awards at the Metro FM awards and Samas, bribed people for them to win the gongs."One million views everyday but no sync deals? No endorsements? Are we buying awards?" he said.He also suggested that Mahumapelo or other stable employees were sleeping with underage girls."Y'all should stop with the subliminals thou, got alot on ya ... stop sleeping with underage kids. Women ain't loyal, they outchea talking."Mathiba has been ordered to appear in the same court later this month to show cause why the order should not be made permanent.Issued on March 28, the order decreed that Mathiba was "interdicted and restrained from publishing or disseminating false, malicious and defamatory information and material about Mahumapelo through the use of Twitter or any other social medium."Mahumapelo said the order was an indication that all South Africans are equal before the law."This means people cannot spread malicious rumours on social media platforms and get away with it. We have obtained the order to clear our names and to protect the reputation of the company, which we worked so hard for."It is a lesson to all of us that what you say on social media with the intention of harming others will eventually get back to haunt you," he said.Mathiba declined to comment.
