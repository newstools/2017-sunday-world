Look it was awesome to feel all the love last night as people watched me. I was so emotional.I cried and I still can t explain the joy of playing Goodness or having people fall in love with her so soon she said.She added that the chance to play the role came at the right time in her career having just played a small role in another Ferguson Films production Igazi. Zenande also shared that she spends so much time with the cast and crew they have literally became my family .She pointed out that although she has worked with Ferguson Films before there is a lot more interaction with the team this time and she sees it as a blessing. I work with talented people and to have had people like Bra Sello (Sello Maake ka Ncube) say the things they have said about my craft is truly an honour she said.Zenande plays the role of an enigmatic woman named Goodness whom she says will always have viewers wondering what she is up. She said that viewers will only really get to know who Goodness is over the coming weeks but it will be a journey worth watching. In this industry you are only as good as your last performance and I have decided that I want to let my work do all the talking for me she said.
