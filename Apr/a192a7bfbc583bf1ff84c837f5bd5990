 In an international survey undertaken by the medical teleconsultation website Zava most of the men and women polled in the US and Europe say their ideal size is a C-cup. Sunday World has conducted a snap survey of South Africa's male celebs on their preferred size.TV presenter and businessman Maps Maponyane said boobs were no big deal for him."I have never really been a boob person," he chuckled. "They are not actually my main attraction. There are other important features that I look at in a woman and boobs comes last."Former Generations and Broken Vows actor Mandla Gaduka, popularly known as Choppa, said a C-cup was the winner."It fits in my hand, [and is] easy to handle," said Gaduka. "It does not overwhelm you or underwhelm you, it's sexy to handle."He said he had always been intimidated by bigger sizes."I feel like I would be so overwhelmed that I would ask her to breastfeed me," he giggled.Orlando Pirates midfielder Mpho Makola said he preferred them "medium"."I have to be able to handle them. Obviously if they are too big, I would have to work hard at handling them."Rapper KO agreed with Makola, saying a C-cup worked better for him."I don't like excessive breasts. But I don't dwell too much on them," said KO.Football legend Doctor Khumalo said he used to dwell on women's features until he learnt an embarrassing lesson away from home."While I was still playing in the US, I saw a woman dressed in a mini dress and her boobs were too big. Her body was also confusing. I could not even understand what was going on with her and then I laughed."My teammates turned and asked me what was funny..." he said.Khumalo said his teammates scolded him and told him that "if you can't change it, then you have no right to laugh at it".Since then he has learnt to keep his opinions of how other people look to himself, he said.
