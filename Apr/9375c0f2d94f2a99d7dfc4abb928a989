 Ndamase, whose latest single Ndiphendule is on high rotation on major radio stations, said he had succumbed to pressure related with job security when he enrolled for the course at the University of Johannesburg in 2009."Many black children always feel the pressure to make as much money as possible. I knew that music would afford me a decent pay," she said.He said when he finally got to do what he loved he gave it his undivided attention."I realised that I liked music more and there is nothing I can do better than music."Before dropping out, I asked myself if it was worth it to do something just for the sake of finishing or focusing on something I was really passionate about."What's the use of having a degree to just hang it in my mother's dining room?" he asked.Ndamase, who is from Mount Ayliff in the Eastern Cape, said he will be releasing his debut album titled Impumelelo Ndibize next month.He said he has always loved singing, writing and reading but got the reaffirmation when he represented his school in a solo singing competition.Ndamase said his career took off after another amateur musician heard him sing in church."We soon formed a group and performed a lot together but my focus shifted completely when I started studying."Things changed again when I went solo and my first single Ndofika Nini made me popular in my home province of the Eastern Cape," he said.
