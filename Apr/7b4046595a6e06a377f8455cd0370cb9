 Moloi, a qualified chef, used her culinary expertise to raise R50000 in one night and coaxed people into pledging R150000 to build a house for the Masilela family.The family of six, headed by Thembisile Masilela, 23, is living in a dilapidated house. The family often goes to bed with empty stomachs.Moloi leapt to their assistance after learning of their plight.She said she did the charity work through her NGO, Thalitha Koum. The event was held at Mike's Kitchen in Polokwane, where she prepared food and sold it."I was able to raise R50000 and other people pledged R150000. We will start with the construction of the house soon. The construction people said we need at least R200000 to build and furnish the house."I was touched by the sorry state of affairs because while we struggle every day to better our lives, they struggle to get money to buy food and have no decent roof over their heads. They need to get their dignity back," she said.Thembisile and her siblings, who were orphaned 10 years ago, hailed Moloi. "She is a God-send. We believe that she will restore our dignity by building the house for us. We hope that they will finish building the house before winter. We thank mama Moloi."
