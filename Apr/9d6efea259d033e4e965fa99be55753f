 This is the view of City coach Eric Tinkler, whose well rested side welcomes third-placed Amakhosi to Cape Town Stadium tonight (7.30pm) for a crunch Absa Premiership meeting.Tinkler has described the clash as "a must win" after the league leaders dropped points at home against fellow title rivals Bidvest Wits in a 1-1 draw last week."It's not easy playing 120 minutes and then going to a penalty shootout and then not getting the result. And then you have to play another big match. It's a big headache for him [Chiefs coach Steve Komphela]. He has to worry about squad selection and rotation.That's something we do not need to worry about because we have had enough days to recover," Tinkler told media at a press conference yesterday."It's a tough match, a must win. We've reached a stage where we've got nothing to lose. We have to be highly motivated, extremely disciplined and have a good work ethic."City beat Amakhosi 1-0 in the MTN8 early this season and held the Soweto giants to a 1-1 draw at FNB Stadium in their first round league clash.Chiefs' goalkeeper and captain Itumeleng Khune is a doubfful starter.
