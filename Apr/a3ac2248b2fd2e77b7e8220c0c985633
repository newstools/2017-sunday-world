 And while Pirates are looking to finish the season strongly by winning a cup, the same can't be said about Celtic.Siwelele are battling relegation in 13th spot so the Nedbank Cup could be seen as a distraction.Celtic are also now coachless after Luc Eymael was ordered to return to Polokwane City. The Belgian had resigned as City coach last month and joined Celtic 24 hours later.Celtic won three matches, drew two and lost just one during Eymael's short-lived spell at the club. It's now back to square one for them with Lehlohonolo Seema continuing as interim coach, while Eymael appeals the PSL's verdict.It will be interesting to see how coachless Celtic fare against Pirates, considering they have a crucial league match against another relegation-threatened side, Highlands Park, at Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium on Tuesday.Against Pirates, Celtic will be buoyed by the fact that they beat Bucs at Orlando Stadium in a league match in December, under Seema.Pirates, meanwhile, are desperate to avoid a third consecutive trophyless season.
