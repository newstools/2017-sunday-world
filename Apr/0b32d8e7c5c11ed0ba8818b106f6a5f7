 The players walked back to the tunnel with broad smiles and manager Bobby Motaung embraced goalscorer George Lebese with the words "Georgie Boy, Georgie Boy, Georgie Boy".Good times are back at Chiefs after a shaky first half of the season, and they are hoping that their run of 12 unbeaten matches in the league will inspire them to their fifth PSL title.They've got a good chance, but it would require the same concentration and fighting spirit they showed against Chippa.Chiefs are tied on 45 points with leaders Cape Town City, who host Bidvest Wits in the Mother City tomorrow. The winner will stay top of the log.Ironically, Chiefs' next league match will also be away to Cape Town City next Tuesday, yet another battle for the No1 spot on the PSL table."Every team has a bad run once in a while, but we had to come together to say what the way forward would be," said Amakhosi right-back Ramahlwe Mphahlele."The game is not about the tactical and technical part of it. The mental part is the most important. We work very hard on our mental strength, to fill it with positive thoughts everyday; that has been paying off.""Rama" added: "It's not easy for the team to stick together when things are going bad. Most teams break down, but we knew that we have the personnel to keep going."The most important thing is to stay up there with the top teams [on the standings]."Chiefs have not lost in the second round of the season.
