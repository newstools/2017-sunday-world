 Wits finished the weekend on top of the Absa Premiership table and now turn their focus to knockout competition football against a Cosmos side currently in eighth position in the National First Division."We will be happy to win this cup. We have been doing well in the past few seasons, but we have not had what we think we deserve."If we win this game and progress, then we have a chance to win this cup," said Wits defender Buhle Mkhwanazi yesterday."I [however] think it's still too early to say if a treble is possible. There are a whole lot of teams who are doing well at the moment. We will see how things go at a later stage."Mkhwanazi admitted that they do not know anything about Cosmos, which could make life difficult for the Clever Boys."Honestly we know nothing about them. We know that they are a tricky side. They've been in the Premiership before, so they have that experience. That's why we need to take this game as seriously as any other," said Mkhwanazi."NFD teams always give PSL teams a good run, so we need to be focused. We must play as if it's a cup final. That way we can win the match."Last 16 fixturesTonight (all 7.30pm)Baroka v P Stars, Old Peter Mokaba Stadium;KwaDukuza United v SuperSport, Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium; Cosmos v Wits, Tsakane Stadium.Saturday (3pm unless stated)Sundowns v Arrows, Lucas Moripe Stadium;Chippa v Polokwane City, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium; FS Stars v Orlando Pirates, James Motlatsi Stadium, 8.15pmSundayBloem Celtic v Mbombela, Dr Molemela Stadium;Acornbush v Chiefs, Kabokweni Stadium.
