"The inmates respect her and she's protective in the prison and feared as well, wanting to create a safe environment for those close to her"As Mazet she has to be Mzansi's toughest and roughest gangsta gal - streetwise, hardcore, fearless, yet with a softer side to her, sympathetic and vulnerable.King has captivated the hearts of television viewers and had many sympathising with the character every time the drama aired.Mazet is a hardcore prisoner respected by fellow inmates, but just ahead of her release, a prison warder frames her for killing his colleague .She is found guilty and sentenced to 15 year behind bars.Desperate for freedom and to spend time with her daughter, Mazet resorted to breaking out of prison. But found herself right back.And like most of the women in the prison, her sentence is the result of violence by men.King says Mazet has some similar characteristics to her, in the sense that they are both loving mothers."I am a mother and I am passionate about my children. I can understand why Mazet will do everything in her power, including breaking out of prison and killing someone, just to be with her child. Any mother can relate to that," she said.Although King could relate to Mazet, she had challenges portraying her because she knew nothing about prison life."I didn't know anything about prison life for women before this role, it was just not something I had thought about before," she said..She told Sunday World she had to learn to be vulnerable to be able to get to the core of the character and understand Mazet fully.The response from the viewers has assured King that she was heading in the right direction, she said."People stop me to tell me how impressed they are, how we are telling a story that's never been told before," she said.She described Mazet as a deep and hardcore woman but also someone who has a softer side to her."The inmates respect her and she's protective in the prison and feared as well, wanting to create a safe environment for those close to her," King said.Trained in speech and drama at the Natal Technikon (now UKZN), the Eshowe, KwaZulu-Natal lass said her acting career kicked off quite late in her life.She first spent 10 years in the corporate world."I was exposed to tourism as a hotel tour guide."I later became regional manager of a hotel chain. Eventually, I outgrew that and ventured into sales and marketing but deep down my passion was to be a performing artist," she said.King got her first break in 2010 when well-known Durban playwright and director Jerry Pooe roped her in to the play, Dance in the Valley, at The Durban Playhouse. Other theatre productions, Ngafunga Amabomvu and Idlozi, followed.In the same year she was cast on Mzansi Magic's telenovela iNkaba and sky-rocketed to fame when she appeared on SABC1's Uzalo, where she plays Lindiwe Xulu.King said growing up she had always known that she wanted to be a performer, which was why she studied drama."It was in 2014 when my acting career came to life - I did two short films and landed the role on Uzalo," she said.She said her future plans were to continue showcasing her God-given talent and do what she is passionate about.The finale of Lockdown aired on Monday on Mzansi Magic channel 161.
