 The organisation said the SABC spurned the gospel diva's funeral because she was a ZCC- affiliated artist.Ramathoka was buried in Tshwane two weeks ago after succumbing to a short illness. Only a few SABC radio stations covered the funeral, but they too did not broadcast it live.This incensed LAM, which wrote a letter of complaint to the broadcaster.The letter reads in part: "We are not happy with SABC News TV because it is sidelining Sion (ZCC) artists in news coverage. We saw the coverage of the late Sfiso [Ncwane], Lundi [Tyamara], Joe Mafela etc. But now with Matlakala [it] is a different issue. We need SABC to treat legendary artists equally regardless of religion."The letter was signed by LAM chairman Mphoza Mashabela, who also said the SABC must provide cogent reasons why it failed to cover the funeral to debunk the notion that it was discriminatory."The funeral was attended by famous artists [such as] Deborah Frazer, Solly Moholo [and] Conny Lamola. We really appreciate SABC radio stations Thobela FM, Motsweding and Lesedi FM for covering the event. However, TV is sidelining and dividing artists."SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago refuted LAM's claims that the broadcaster was tribalistic and discriminatory in its approach to coverage of artists' funerals."We are not discriminating against anyone on the basis of anything. What they need to know is that SABC is not only TV, there were radio stations there which covered the funeral. But if they are not happy with us they are at liberty to come to our offices and engage with us," he said.
