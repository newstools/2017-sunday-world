 Matheba broke the news this afternoon on social media in a short statement. After 3 years of making magic on the Front Row, I can confirm that I have officially stepped down as the host of the show....., she wrote on Twitter. I will miss my Metro FM family dearly, as they say all good things do come to an end....Looking forward to the next chapter of my radio life.
