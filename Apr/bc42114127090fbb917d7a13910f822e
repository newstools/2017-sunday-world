 Khanyi became the talk of the town for days last week after Twitter users showed no mercy in dragging her over her pink complexion .While Khanyi hit back at the backlash with a string of spicy clap backs she didn t address the frenzy in detail.During an interview with Phat Joe on East Coast radio after the storm had simmered down Khanyi spoke out about the fiasco.The actress explained that her complexion is not pink but it was a case of an over-filtered picture. It was a picture that was over-filtered and people assumed that that was the colour of my skin. Khanyi also confirmed that she had been lightening her skin for the past six years and while people noticed the change they didn t have the courage to question her over it. It has always been a question but people weren t strong enough to come out and ask me why am I getting lighter and lighter every year. Eventually that picture opened up the opportunity for people to come at me and say we know what you re doing she said.When Joe asked Khanyi why she embarked on her skin-lightening journey Khanyi said that it was a personal choice. There is something about a woman who looks brighter but there is a difference between lightening and bleaching. Lightening is non-invasive it also boosts your immune system and helps with anti-ageing. Khanyi also revealed that she hoped to open her own clinic one day. I found love in this and I m using myself as a study so that I can then open similar clinics one day she added.Speaking to TshisaLIVE in the wake of the frenzy that erupted around her Khanyi said that she didn t care about the hate. 13 years later and people still question everything I do. I just stay blessed she said.
