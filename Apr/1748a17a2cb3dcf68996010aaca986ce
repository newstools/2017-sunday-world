 While he was out nursing a knee injury, Sundowns were struggling for form with a run of five matches without a win in the Absa Premiership. Since Onyango's return, Sundowns have won two in two and they have not conceded, also beating Free State Stars 1-0 on Sunday.Football is, of course, a team sport but there are certain players who make a huge difference and Onyango is one of those, both with his performances and experience."It was good to be back on the field after a long time. I think I was out for six to seven weeks, so it was good to come back in a game like the Tshwane derby. It was a turning point for us," said Onyango, who is hyped up for the second meeting between the Tshwane rivals at Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight (7.30pm)."Obviously, SuperSport will come back with a huge fight, but we are ready for it. It's going to be an interesting game."The emphatic victory over now fifth-placed Matsatsantsa was a reminder that Sundowns are still very much in the title race.Currently four points behind leaders Cape Town City and Kaizer Chiefs, fourth-placed Sundowns are seeing an opportunity to pounce now that they've rediscovered some form.Onyango said: "We are hoping to do well in our remaining nine matches."We must finish strong. We've lost the other [knockout competition] trophies, so the league is the one left to fight for. We want to win it so that we can play in the Champions League again [next year]."SuperSport need to make major improvements, especially in defence as they were often caught flat footed by the likes of Khama Billiat and Percy Tau.Up front Matsatsantsa need to put more pressure on Sundowns.
