 Pirates' defence has left a lot to be desired this season, having kept just six clean sheets in 28 matches in all competitions.Gcaba, however, believes the team is now disciplined in the way they approach matches since Jonevret took over seven matches ago."He's brought a bit of stability - the calmness. We've been all over the show and the most important thing is that we communicate better, check our lines and play as a unit," Gcaba told Sowetan after their 2-0 win over Maritzburg United on Tuesday night.This was the first time Pirates had kept a clean sheet since Jonevret's arrival in February, and the 54-year-old's maiden Absa victory. "It's getting there as long as the guys are going to continue playing the way they are playing now."We are gaining confidence game by game," added Gcaba, who scored his first goal of the season in Tuesday's triumph.Maritzburg caretaker coach Fadlu Davids drew comparisons to the Pirates team they beat 2-1 in the first round at Harry Gwala Stadium in December, and the one they failed to score against on Tuesday."They are a bit more defensively structured. If you look at the possession stats, they focused a lot on their 4-2-3-1 being compact. [Thabo] Matlaba is usually under-lapping, overlapping and he's all over the pitch," Davids observed.Pirates face Highlands Park on Saturday (8.15pm).
