 To their surprise, the two men aged 28 and 39 were tackled by alert police officers while still on the premises popularly known as Kaizer Chiefs Village.Police spokeswoman Lulo Dube confirmed the arrest of the two men on charges of theft and malicious damage to property and that they would appear in court later this month."The suspects were found in possession of stolen property. They were arrested and detained at Mondeor police station," he said.A cop from Mondeor police station with knowledge of the incident said the two men were caught around midnight after police had received a tip-off."The men gained entry into the Chiefs storeroom [through] the roof. Police watched them as they were loading jerseys, takkies and tracksuits belonging to the club into their car."Once they were done and had evidence in their possession, my colleagues then approached them and arrested them," said the officer who did not want to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.Chiefs spokesman Vina Maphosa said he was not made aware of the incident."If you can sent me an e-mail, I can ask security about it," Maphosa said.He had not responded to the written questions at the time of going to print.
