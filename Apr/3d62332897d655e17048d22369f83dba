 The duo will host new show Homeground from 1 May, which will be simulcast on both Mzansi Magic and SuperSport.The show will give viewers sports news, trivia, celebrity interviews, and social media, with a touch of lifestyle.After her departure from SABC 1 s SoccerZone last year, news of Dlamini following in the footsteps of Robert Marawa and Carol Tshabalala by joining the SuperSport family first broke in January. What I m looking forward to about the show is that it features a variety of sports not just football. The show also offers a really big entertainment platform, so it s breaking down South Africa s existing segregation between the two worlds. Dlamini expressed in a statement.
