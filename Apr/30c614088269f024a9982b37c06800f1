He is out on R500 bail," Makhubele said.A police officer close to the case said the lanky Ngwenya was nabbed by a security guard while smoking dagga in the parking area of the casino complex."The guard said he was doing his rounds in the lower parking area when he sensed the smell of dagga," said the officer, who did not want to be named because he was not allowed to speak to the media.He said the guard followed the smell of the herb until it led him to Ngwenya, who was allegedly found relaxed and puffing away at a joint. The guard alerted police who came and arrested Ngwenya who hung up his boots in 2015 after a two-year spell with Botswana's Township Rollers.
