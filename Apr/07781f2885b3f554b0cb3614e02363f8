 Chomane bade farewell to his emotional listeners on Friday. He had hosted Ha Re Ye Morning Drive Show from 7am to 9am since 1996.The show, which boasted over 1.5-million listeners daily, had a strong self-empowerment theme, a shift from its strong inclination towards sport a few years ago. This also earned him the Steve Tshwete lifetime achievement in the 2015 SA Sport AwardsChomane was a teacher when he joined the station in 1981 as a junior presenter. He told his listeners he was going into business full-time. He owns a funeral services business in Soweto.When we called for comment, he said: "Let's speak next week, I am at a funeral." He'll be replaced by Tsholo Leokaoke from tomorrow.In another shock move at the SABC, 5FM breakfast show presenter DJ Fresh is moving to Metro FM, where breakfast host Glen Lewis has also quit.
