 Combs, who founded the record label in 1993, gave the filmmakers a raw and exclusive behind-the-scenes look at his efforts to reunite the Bad Boy family for a 2016 concert in New York. He said it morphed into a story about family, tragedy and perseverance."It's a piece of my life ... My whole life might have to be a ten-part miniseries or something like that. But you know this is a good slice of my life to let people kind of see who Sean is," Combs told reporters on the red carpet at the Tribeca Film Festival on Thursday."It feels surreal but also I feel proud ... I'm so New York, you know, and to be at the Tribeca Film Festival it's beyond your dreams," added Combs, 47, who was born in Harlem.The screening was followed by a concert in which Lil' Kim, Mase and other label members performed some of their biggest hits.The film will be launched on Apple Music on June 25.
