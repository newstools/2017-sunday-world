 The telenovela premieres tomorrow night, with the first episode kicking off when new matriculants Simi, portrayed by Mbatha, and Zamani Mbatha, who plays herself, leave their families behind in KwaZulu-Natal to pursue a better life in Joburg, when a heist unexpectedly goes wrong.Nandi , 20, from Newcastle in KZN, is a novice having a dream TV role debut.However she "expertly plays tragic rural heroine Simi, a teenage damsel in distress as her move to Joburg goes pear-shaped from day one", according to production house Bomb Productions."Basically this is my first opportunity to be in front of the cameras but I hope to land many more roles. Doors have now been opened for me because I always wanted to be on TV," says Mbatha, a first year Unisa law student."I saw a post on Instagram calling on young actors to come forward to play a leading role in the telenovela. I auditioned, luckily I got the role."I don't know what gave me the edge. I only did what was required of me during the auditions stage." she says.Revealing her story line, Mbatha says Simi, almost like her in real life, is a girl from rural KZN who was raised by her granny but is an ambitious young woman."She's a Zulu maiden to the core, shy, down to earth, sweet and has ambitions of becoming a medical doctor. But along the way things don't work out."Mbatha is a part-time model and has an agency that is building her profile."It's something I still want to pursue," she says."Once I set my mind on something I give it my all. I want to be on TV and to be a model and will study and complete my degree."
