"The respondents have not, prior to leaving their domicilium address, notified the applicant"The public broadcaster had given Tigere Media, then a few months old, a credit facility of R912000 of airtime on SABC1 through a popular show called Take Me Out.However, the company failed to pay the money and later disappeared into thin air when the SABC tried to trace it to recover the money owed.The legal wrangle, which was expected to unfold at the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg in 2015, could not materialise because the sheriff of the court could not locate the address of the company, which at the time of applying for credit with the SABC, had listed two addresses - one in KwaZulu-Natal and another in Midrand.The SABC therefore abandoned the lawsuit against the company in 2016.But the broadcaster was now back in court to ask the law to help it locate the company directors and addresses to recover their R912000.Tigere Media is owned by Tigere brothers Atwell and Archibold, believed to have last been seen in 2015 after they were alerted to the breach of the credit facility by the SABC."The respondents have not, prior to leaving their domicilium address, notified the applicant, not even of their new address," reads the court papers.According to supporting documents filed by the SABC, Tigere Media had used a property in Midrand owned by one of their companies, Mastermax Production, as surety in their credit application. The property was worth R9-million and bonded for R6-million.The documents indicate that the company had asked for a credit limit of R3.5-million.The company stated that its annual turnover and asset value were more than R2-million.It appears that before authorising the credit, the SABC had not done a credit check against the directors of Tigere Media.A credit report that was filed as part of the application by their lawyer to establish Tigere Media's new address reveals that one of the directors of the company had default judgments against him effected by Investec Bank in 2012.However, the judgment appears not to have been spotted by the SABC at the time of granting the credit facility.
