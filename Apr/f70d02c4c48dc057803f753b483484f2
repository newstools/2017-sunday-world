 These include "the right to life, survival and development and to the highest attainable standard of health".But we should recognise that when our society forces mothers to breastfeed in public toilets, it is a violation of their basic human rights.Hundreds of scientific studies on the subject are clear: breastfeeding a child for the first 12 months of its life is the best way to ensure it grows up healthy. Yet nursing mothers are subjected to harassment and public shaming if they breastfeed in public."It's an indictment on our society that we tolerate topless models in our fashion magazines, but that breastfeeding mothers are chased out of public spaces on a daily basis," says Stasha Jordan, breastfeeding activist and executive director of the South African Breast Milk Reserve."Many mothers are forced to use public bathrooms to feed their babies rather than face this kind of abuse," says Jordan.When a toilet is flushed without first closing the lid, fine droplets of excrement are sprayed into the air. These can drift around the room for up to two hours and these droplets carry a wide variety of pathogens, many of which could prove deadly to an infant's fragile immune system.Breastfeeding at work is already protected under South African law. This protection may, in time, be extended to mothers breastfeeding in other public spaces.The Normalise Public Breastfeeding in SA movement represents hundreds of women in the country.Together, they have drafted the Breastfeeding and Related Matters Bill - a proposed law that will protect mothers from discrimination in public, and have submitted it to the office of health minister.To know more or to get involved, visit www.sabr.org.za
