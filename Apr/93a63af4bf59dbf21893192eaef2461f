 The soul singer is a trainee accountant working on becoming a chartered accountant."I am also doing my honours with Unisa," she said.Zuke, 26, said although she had always loved music, she wanted to have a sound education to back her music career."My plan is to work for the next three to four years and pursue board exams to qualify as a CA then from there I will be my own boss," she said."Being my own boss will enable me to give my music more attention. Currently I try to balance my work and my music career because most of my gigs are after hours and on weekends."She said she was grateful because her employers were supportive of her singing career.Zuke told Sunday World that she started singing at the age of 13 at a church choir and later became part of a gospel group.She said her singing career started to blossom in 2011 when the group decided to record their music."While recording, the owner of the studio said I had a nice voice and invited me to back up some artists," she said."I later told him that I wanted to be a soul music artist and we started recording. I was at varsity at the time and we decided not to release any of my music so that I could focus on my academic work," she said.Her first single to introduce her to the market was released last year and she reckons it has been well received."I will release my debut album before the end of July."
