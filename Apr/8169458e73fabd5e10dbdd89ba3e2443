 The gospel group who are also celebrating 21 years in the music industry recorded their album titled Heal The Land at US Bishop TD Jakes church in Dallas last year. In a time where sales are not that great we are humbled that people really believe in us co-founder of Joyous Celebration Lindelani Mkhize said.The 3-CD album has a mixture of new songs as well as old songs from their previous albums as they have incorporated some of the alumni of the choir in the recording. Lindelani said that finding out the news was a pleasant surprise for the Joyous family. As a 21-year-old South African brand that has continuously attempted to spread a message of healing (and particularly healing our land) and of encouragement we are very happy that our message is touching people he said.The group will be beginning their national tours next week and Lindelani has promised that their fans can expect fireworks .
