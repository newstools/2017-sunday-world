 The six-time SA 100m champion confirmed his entry in the short dash where he is set to face-off other local sprinters who boast sub-10 seconds personal best times, like Akani Simbine (9.89, SA record), Thando Roto (9.95), Henricho Bruintjies (9.97) and Wayde van Niekerk (9.98)."I am back to reclaim what was taken from me. I have never been beaten on South African soil and I don't see that happening soon," warned Magakwe, who said he'll run in honour of his late mom."I am proud of all the local speedsters that broke the 10-second barrier after I led the way," added the flamboyant sprinter whose 9.98 seconds performance at the 2014 nationals opened the floodgates of the exclusive SA sub-10 club.Magakwe, 30, has also vowed to teach his rivals something new, despite having raced just twice - a league and a provincial meeting in Rustenburg last month, both of which he won.Before then, he last competed in Italy in September 2014, three months prior to his two-year ban after he missed a random out-of-competition drugs test, which IAAF considers a doping violation.
