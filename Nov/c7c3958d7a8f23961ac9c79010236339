Co-founder of Joyous Celebrations Lindelani Mkhize says never in his wildest dream did he imagine the project would be as big as it is. He said it felt like a dream that they will be recording their 22nd album this year . "Time flies, I can't believe it has been 22 years. It still feels like it was yesterday," he said. Mkhize told Sunday World that sticking to their original vision has kept them going throughout the years. "We are this big today because we stayed true to our vision. We also evolved and moved with the times, that is why we are still relevant 20 years later," Mkhize said. He said they had launched careers, changed lives while others have been able to provide for their families through the opportunities they offered. He said Joyous was a project created to give opportunity to talent available in townships. He said as long as there was talent, the future of Joyous Celebration would remain bright. Mkhize said the crew will shoot their 22nd project at Maropeng Cradle of Mankind on December 9. The title of this year's album is All for You. "All for You is a celebration of the accomplishments we have achieved thus far and the support we have enjoyed from our fans in the past 21 years," said Mkhize.
