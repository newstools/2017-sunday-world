SuperSport United chairman Khulu Sibiya almost died at the hands of gun-toting tsotsis before he could see his team play in the final of the Caf Confederation Cup. This after two thugs accosted Sibiya at his home in northern Joburg and attempted to hijack his Mercedes Benz last month.Â  Sibiya, who is also a big boss at payTV companies M-Net and MultiChoice, said he chose to "rather die" than follow the criminals' instructions to open his door and get out. Although Sibiya said the incident was traumatic and scary, he was not willing to give "desperate criminals what they wanted". "I told them that if they are so desperate to get something they have not work hard for, then they must shoot me because I was not going to open the door," said Sibiya. He described the perpetrators as "dirty and unashamed". "You should have seen them, they were so dirty. I suspect that they followed me from the garage. They blocked the gate after I drove into my property and pointed firearms at me, instructing me to get out of the car," said Sibiya. He said a handyman was fixing his DStv at his home at the time of the incident. "I drove to the garage to buy him snacks," Sibiya said. "The criminals stood outside my car shouting at me to get out. You should have seen the anger in their faces when I refused. They were so infuriated." He said his attackers then noticed his other car in the driveway had its windows rolled down. They proceeded to it and stole an iPhone worth R16000 and other smaller items before fleeing. Sibiya said he then quickly got into the house to call for help. Police spokesman Molefe Mogodi confirmed that Bramley police were investigating a case of armed robbery, but added that no arrests had been made.
