Former Muvhango actress Sindi Dlathu is set to heat up the small screen again as the leading lady in a new Mzansi Magic drama series. Although Dlathu's character, Thandaza Mokoena, is still very much alive on SABC 2's Muvhango, she has been cast and is on the set of a new show, The River, that is earmarked to premiere early next year. "The drama is the brainchild of a new production house called Thedza Pictures." Award-winning scriptwriter Phathu Makwarela has penned the story line. Mzansi Magic publicity manager Bongiwe Potelwa-Metsing said it would be premature for her to shed light on any aspects of the drama. "There's nothing official at the moment. I'm not working directly with the production. "There's not a single episode that has been delivered for viewing and approval, so we can't go public because we don't even know what the show looks like," she said. Makwarela has worked with Muvhango as well as Rockville on Mzansi Magic and is involved in many other shows, including SABC1's Skeem Saam and Uzalo. Makwarela said he would be able to speak about the show in the next three weeks or so. "Look, we are still tying up the loose ends but we should be able to give details early next month after all parties have been informed about the publicity date." Dlathu stunned Muvhango fans last month when she dropped a bombshell that she was leaving the soapie in which she was the main attraction for 20 years. Sources close to the production said every one was working fast to meet the new year deadline and shooting was already at an advanced staged. Former Generations: The Legacy make-up guru Bongi Mlotshwa, the mother of Enhle Mbali Maphumulo, who is house exponent DJ Black Coffee's wife, is tasked with making some of The River's cast members look beautiful.
