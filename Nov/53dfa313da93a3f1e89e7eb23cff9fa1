Emerging actress Londeka Mlaba studied law for what she terms the "longest two years" of her life just to please her mother. But now Mlaba is famous for her infamous character Sibahle on SABC1 drama series Uzalo after dropping out of her law studies at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. "I've always wanted to be in the entertainment industry. At first I wanted to be a dancer but my mother insisted that I study something serious, in this case it was law," said Mlaba. "She was paying, so I had to do it. I studied for two years but I got to a point where I could no longer do it. I changed course in my third year and studied drama and performance instead. I couldn't continue wasting my mother's money knowing that I was not going to practice as a lawyer." The performer said she switched to drama and performance because she wanted to do something art-related. Mlaba, 26, said after her graduation in �2015, one of her lecturers �advised her to pursue acting as a career, a craft that had never crossed her mind. She went to audition for Uzalo and got a call back and nod in March 2016 to play Sibahle - a long-lost daughter of KwaMashu top detective Dlomo (played by Don Mlangeni Nawa) - who later eloped with Ayanda Mdletshe. On her role, she said Sibahle was a young girl who "liked things". Besides Uzalo, Mlaba also played Zamo on etv's wedding-planning drama series Broken Vows. She recently moved from her hometown of Durban to Joburg, where she feels there are more opportunities for growing her craft. "Besides Uzalo, there isn't much happening in terms of TV productions in Durban ... there are more prospects of getting gigs on shows here in Joburg." Mlaba believes she still has much to learn in the industry before even thinking of taking her craft to international level.
