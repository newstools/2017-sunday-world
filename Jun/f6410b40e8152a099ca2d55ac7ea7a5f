 Police arrested Mokwena at around 7pm on Thursday at his Polokwane offices after he allegedly shot and wounded four people on the ZebedielaCitrus Estate. Mokwena s formal bail application is expected to start on Tuesday 27 June.State prosecutor Advocate Solly Ngobeni said officials were applying for the bail hearing to be postponed so that a detailed profile on Mokwena can be obtained. He said police did not have enough time to obtain the profile because Mokwena was arrested in the evening.According to police reports one firearm was also confiscated during the arrest. Ngobeni added that police needed more time to confirm the condition of one of the victims. However Mokwena s defence lawyer Naledi Mothapo argued that his profile could be confirmed through a simple phone call to the local criminal centre.The presiding magistrate granted the prosecution s application for a postponement.During court proceedings Mokwena who was dressed in a blue sweater made a request for the chains on his ankles to be removed. I shouldn t be in leg chains when I appear before this court. It is very inhumane he said. The public gallery was filled with farm workers wearing read union shirts.
