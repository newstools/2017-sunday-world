 With Handr Pollard of the Bulls and Pat Lambie of the Sharks unavailable for the three Test matches against France due to injuries and Frans Steyn relegated to the bench Jantjies has been given the opportunity at flyhalf and he hasn t disappointed.He grabbed his opportunity in the opening Test at Loftus last weekend where he gave a near flawless performance with his kicking and general play to help the Springboks to a deserved and morale boosting 37-14 win. Elton is maturing in many ways in terms of his leadership and managing the game " said Coetzee."He has a great understanding of how we want to play and managing that balance between the kicking running and spotting space."There are crucial guys among the backs who must assist in those options and I think it makes it easier with Elton (Jantjies) to choose the right option. The clarity of the plan is also important for number nines and tens and he has been playing very well."The big thing for me is that there is a difference with pressure between international rugby and Super Rugby and it seems that he is enjoying this kind of pressure at international rugby. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
