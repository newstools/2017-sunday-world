 Marawa dumped his work in solidarity with his producer Beverly Maphangwa who was suspended by the SABC, allegedly for playing SuperSport content on the Metro FM sports show despite instructions from management advising her not to do so.As a result, Maphangwa was allegedly ordered by SABC management to provide reasons why she should not be suspended on Thursday.Marawa refused to work with a producer who was appointed by management to run the show while Maphangwa was on suspension.He took his fight to social media and tweeted: "My producer Beverly Maphangwa has been suspended 4 'non compliance/contravention of contract'. The crime? We played audio by Sizwe Mabena."I told management that I removed myself from the show because I am the one that actually caused this crime. So I will not be on 2nite."Sunday World learned that SABC's group executive for sports Sully Motsweni was not happy with Marawa's behaviour and informed senior executives that she plans to summon Marawa to a meeting tomorrow where she intends to serve him with a letter of termination of his contract for "misconduct".It is understood that all the executives, including acting group CEO Tsheliso Ralitabo and acting general manager for radio Orapeleng Lebethe, have endorsed her decision.Marawa told Sunday World that he has no knowledge about tomorrow's meeting but did not care if he were fired.TO READ THE FULL STORY GET A COPY OF TODAY'S SUNDAY WORLD AT YOUR NEAREST STORE
