"I'm going to interdict M-Net from airing Isithembiso until the court makes decision."Slow Moletsane, of Vusamazulu Films, has instructed his attorneys from Amos Khumalo Incorporated to communicate his intentions of interdicting the airing of Isithembiso because it was a concept stolen from him.Moletsane told Sunday World he had sent proposals for five films to MultiChoice in 2015 for their consideration on their Mzansi Magic channels.He claims that after confirmation receipt of his work, MultiChoice said they liked only four of his films and rejected his proposal, which is similar to Isithembiso."I was shocked two months ago when I saw the trailer of Isithembiso because it looks exactly like my concept, which was rejected by M-Net," he said.Moletsane said he was never offered reasons why his idea was rejected and he never questioned the channel as they had approved four of his films.He claims that after he saw the trailer, it dawned on him that the rejected idea was actually his best work.He said the four films which were approved by MultiChoice are currently running on Mzansi Magic. They are Otla Hola Otla Dibona, Rafifi, Bulang Ditsela and Sabina.Amos Khumalo Incorporated's litigation secretary Malika de Villiers confirmed they were representing Moletsane on the legal matter against MultiChoice."We can confirm that we are representing Mr Moletsane on the matter. Mr Khumalo has asked the client to deal with the media directly," she said.M-Net spokeswoman Bongiwe Potelwa-Metsing could neither confirm nor deny the legal battle."I have made the inquiry with production. We are not aware of any legal claim brought forward against Isithembiso," she said.Moletsane said he suspects that one of the officials at MultiChoice leaked his proposal to Isithembiso's production company Bomb Production after he submitted his proposal because it was "the best concept"."They decided to approve the least powerful films from my submission to dupe me. But I'm going to fight until the end. I'm going to interdict M-Net from airing Isithembiso until the court decides if it's my concept or not. They have stolen from me."Moletsane said he wants to be credited as the creator for the popular telenovela which currently airs on Mzansi Magic from Monday to Thursday."They must also pay me for my hard work," he said.
