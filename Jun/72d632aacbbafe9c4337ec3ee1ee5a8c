 He had paid maintenance for only five months before running back to court to argue that the hefty papgeld was punching holes in his pocket.The ex-soccer player, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has launched a counterclaim application asking to be relieved of the steep monthly spousal maintenance order.The high court ordered late last year that the retired player pay that amount per month as well as his wife's legal costs to the tune of R75000.His wife had demanded that he pay the amount towards her spousal maintenance for a period of five years or until she remarries.However, after paying for about five months, the former professional player has now gone back to court to plead poverty. He also accused his wife of concealing information about her income and assets to the court.According to documents filed in the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg last week, the husband states that his wife's demands are four times more than his monthly income of R60000 and that he cannot afford to foot the bill anymore.In the same application, he claims that his wife had concealed to the court that she owns a R3-million property in a foreign country and that she over-exaggerated his worth and income to milk him in an attempt to get him to default on his maintenance so he can be incarcerated.In claiming the R200000 monthly maintenance, the wife had claimed that the man received financial compensation from two companies in which he was a director. The ex-player had admitted being part of the two entities but told the court he was not receiving any financial benefit from them.He told the court that his assets were valued only at R1.6-million, and argued that since the start of the divorce proceedings, his net assets had decreased to R880000 in value - a loss of close to R800000.In the same application, he states that he was experiencing financial challenges and he was homeless.He also disclosed to the court that the SA Revenue Service was on his case, demanding an immediate payment of close to R40000 owed by him.He said due to his financial position, he was unable to pay the said amount.He was now relying on the generosity of his father's club, who had provided him with accommodation at one of the club's apartments normally reserved for the club's assistant coach. He also revealed that it was not a permanent arrangement as he was expected to vacate the flat any time the club wanted to utilise it.In order to move in with his parents, he must be prepared to fork out R5000 a month to help with household needs.He said his parents told him he was not welcome at their property if he was not prepared to pay the stated amount.
