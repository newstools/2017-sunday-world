 This comes after Tau was nabbed by Limpopo police early this month doing 170km/h, instead of the maximum speed limit of 120km/h, in his white VW Polo on the N1 freeway near the Nyl Plaza tollgate.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the charges against the Emalahleni-born dribbling wizard.He said Tau was caught exceeding the speed limit and was taken into custody at Mokopane police station. He had to pay bail of R1000 in the Mokopane Regional Court to secure his freedom.He will make his second appearance next month.Tau's representative Mmatsatsi Sefalafala confirmed that her client was caught on the wrong side of the law."He was running late for charity work in Limpopo, but he has learnt that even if one is driven by Godly desire to improve the lives of destitute people, it still requires them to observe traffic rules. There were no other charges except that of exceeding the speed limit."When asked of the details of the "charity work" Tau was rushing to, she said: "The charity work was not his initiative ... he was honouring an invitation. We don't have consent to give out the details of the foundation which invited him."However, Sundowns spokesman Thulani Thuswa said Tau was speeding because he was late for Downs teammate Tiyani Mabunda's development tournament."He is a well-behaved boy, on and off the field, and is a hard worker. It was just a mistake," said Thuswa.
