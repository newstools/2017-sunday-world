 The couple who two months ago held an Umembeso (exchanging of gifts) ceremony which is usually celebrated before a wedding have been hard at work to prepare for their big day.Speaking to TshisaLIVE Kwesta said that Yolanda was planning a grand affair. It s her dream to have a grand wedding. So she s in charge of it all. She s been working on the date and all the details. It s a day where I am going to be completely useless. She is going to tell me what to wear where to stand and what to do. I am just going to be the bank Kwesta said with a laugh.The couple have a young daughter together and several months ago committed to each other by getting matching ring-finger tattoos. We got them before anyone even knew that we were planning to get married. I just woke up one day and was like this is what I want to do and I hope she likes it. At first it s all about the romance and love but over time it becomes about growth and I want to grow my family with her and my daughter Kwesta said.He said that the best part about being a soon-to-be-husband was that he doesn t go hungry. She is always cooking. There s always something to eat. But preparing for marriage also grounds you. It shows you things you didn t know before. I used to think about the future as one or two years from now but now I think about my daughter s years in varsity and how I can set her up. That s 18 years ahead. I m thinking further than I have ever thought before he revealed.In fact this sometimes keeps him up at night. I m always thinking about what kind of father I am to my daughter and how I can be better. Fatherhood is a learning curve. I can t sit here and say I am father of the year but I am working towards that he added.
