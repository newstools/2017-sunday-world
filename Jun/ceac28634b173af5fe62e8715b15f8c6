 During an interview with Move! magazine Brenda opened up about her health scare late last year which saw her being hospitalised for a recurring kidney condition called pyelonephritis (a bacterial infection that causes inflammation.)Brenda told the magazine she has been suffering with the condition for a long time and knows that it will always come back. I know life is short so I live the best life and try by all means to enjoy life. I have also been struggling with losing weight after giving birth so that also affects me she said.Even though Brenda s health may not be in the best shape she is determined not to let that affect the many hats she wears.Speaking to TshisaLIVE earlier this year Brenda said that she was focused on losing weight and living a healthy lifestyle. My son is part of the reason I cannot afford too slag on my exercise and healthy eating. I have to live for him she said.Brenda added that even though it was a difficult time in her life she put her trust in God.
