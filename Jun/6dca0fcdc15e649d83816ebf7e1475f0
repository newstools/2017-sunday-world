 Ntsiki recently returned to studio after a lengthy spell away at school and confirmed to TshisaLIVE that she will release a hip-hop track later this week. I just finished working on a track that I think is going to be super big. It s a rap song which is different because I never thought that I would ever do rap music again she said.Ntsiki said she gave up on music two years ago because of a lack of opportunities but was recently approached by a record label to release a song. She eventually agreed only to discover that they wanted to do a rap song. I heard the beat and immediately realised that I had to drop some bars on it. I hadn t rapped in years. I had actually been groomed to be a rapper but then I was blocked by other elements. Now I think this is the perfect time to make a return to that side of music Ntsiki said.To show how serious she is Ntsiki has been working with well-known producer KB who has previously produced hits for Boom Shaka Thembi Seete and Zola.But Ntsiki doesn t have high hopes of the track being picked up by radio stations. It s not going to be played on radio because it speaks to the government and the leadership in this country. We will be dropping it online and hopefully it goes viral so that everyone can hear it she said.Ntsiki said that she is embracing rap despite believing that male rappers have screwed the genre up. Male rappers only tell half the story of hip-hop. There is so much more depth to the genre that is not touched on because rap music is so patriarchal. There s no space for female rappers unless they act or dress like Nicki Minaj she added.
