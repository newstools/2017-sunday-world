 The musician who has a child with rapper Molemo Jub Jub Maaronhanye and another with late Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa spoke out during an interview with Metro FM s DJ Fresh on Friday. I don t think I ve ever been in love or loved the way I wished to be. It s always been about who s around me and who s giving me attention. It s never really been about love or being in love with a particular person Kelly said.Reflecting on her relationship with Jub Jub she said that she no longer spoke to the rapper and struggled to think of anything good to say about him. One day I would love to tell them (my children) about him and my son would love to know about his father outside of the bad relationship me and him (Jub Jub) had. I don t know what I would say because I have nothing good to say about that person. I would like to paint a perfect picture for him but it is not there she said.Kelly said that she would protect her child from Jub Jub until he was 18 and could make his own decisions. I don t know what he is like now and I don t wish to know but based on what I know about him I want to protect my son from that person. The man I know is not deserving of raising my son. I m sure he has changed but for himself not for me she added.Speaking about the heartbreak of losing Senzo in a botched robbery in 2014 Kelly said that she didn t wish the experience on her worst enemy. One minute we were at the top of the mountain in happiness and the next I was at the bottom of the sea buried by everything. I felt like I died there with him. I was not just dealing with the loss but with the entire country bombarding me with things I was not responsible for she said.Kelly said she would never heal from losing Senzo and felt robbed because she had so many questions that would go unanswered and her daughter would never get the chance to grow up with a father.
