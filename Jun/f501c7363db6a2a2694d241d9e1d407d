"Growing up next to my father, I learned to be authoritative and look fierce"The show, which has just completed its run at the Joburg Theatre in Braamfontein, tells the story of when Nigeria first got its independence, following the lives of eight young people in the 1960s, right after British colonial rule.The young men and women from various ethnic and tribal groups share a common goal of seeking love and success as they move to the city of Lagos.They have the time of their lives at Lagos's best night club, Kakadu, where they spend most of their evenings.On one of their joyful nights at Kakadu, their fun suddenly comes to an end when soldiers barge in unannounced.This marks the beginning of the country's Bufari War, which shattered their peaceful existence.The play showcases the glorious past of the country when all ethnic groups could gel together in harmony, and how the war destroyed that.It also portrays how the country picked up the pieces to eventually be where it is today.In portraying Ezennaya, Okeke represents his Eastern Nigerian tribe - a role he takes on with sheer brilliance.But he said as a young man he never anticipated being on stage, taking on big roles.He said his character is that of a father and a leader who respects tradition.The role was not difficult for him because his father was a king and he learned one or two things on how to behave."Growing up next to my father, I learned to be authoritative and look fierce," he said.The 29-year-old is also a singer and guitarist."I always loved the entertainment industry but never thought of it as a career."I sang in church and as a child I joined musical bands," he said.His father, who is his hero, had not one, but five wives.But Okeke said those were the best days of his life as his family was still united.His parents wanted him to become a doctor but he ended up studying computer engineering at Lagos State University."I worked after graduation but on a contract basis. I had now grown to love entertainment as well."After he realised there was more to the entertainment industry than music, he enrolled to study theatre for a year at the Royal Arts Academy."From then I started getting gigs in various theatre productions, movies and series," he said.This jack-of-all-trades said he is determined to make a name for himself as a singer, guitarist as well as actor, not only in the north African country but beyond.
