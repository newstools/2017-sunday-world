 Players who were carrying niggling injuries took part in the morning training session yesterday, and did not look like they had any problems.Tiyani Mabunda, Andile Jali, Aubrey Ngoma, Mulomowandau Mathoho and Lebogang Manyama - some of the players who had knocks - were lively in training, while Rivaldo Coetzee and Tokelo Rantie only did some light workouts.Coetzee and Rantie also took part in the training session where the players were playing one-touch football with two players in the middle of the circle trying to win the ball.Bafana coach Stuart Baxter was visibly delighted with the progress the injured players were making in training.Coetzee has a problem with his hamstring and Rantie has problems with right toe and knee."It was really Tokelo and Rivaldo we were more worried about, but they have responded to treatment.If they are not 100%percent, then we have to make a call on that one. [But] I think they will be okay," said Baxter.Baxter said he is surprised with the high levels of energy in the camp, especially after a long season of club football.It could be because the players want to impress the new coach or that and they are hyped up to face a Nigerian side the South Africans have not beaten in a competitive match.
