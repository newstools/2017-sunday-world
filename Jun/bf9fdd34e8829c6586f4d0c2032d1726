 Pirates players were regularly out of position roamed around the field at will and left massive gaps on the field in an undisciplined show that allowed their opponents to pick them off. It was a nightmare said Jonevret of the 90 minutes that confirmed one of the worst seasons in Pirates history. But it was just 1-0 at a half-time and we said at half time we can change this . The players really wanted to do some thing good here at the end of the season. In the second half I thought we would get back into the game especially after Siya (Mpontshane) saved that penalty. It gave the team some energy but after they scored the second goal it was tough because it looked as if we had forgotten everything we had talked about. They didn t follow the game plan and it looked bad ugly. It could have been more than 4-1. I really don t know what happened there. This was not the Orlando Pirates that we have previously seen even if we have not had a fantastic season. We had stabilised a little bit but this was not a reflection of that. SuperSport were much better. They did the simple things much better. They did not make any mistakes. I m very disappointed and so are the players and the staff and I can understand the supporters are very disappointed also he added having had one or two objects thrown at him at the end of the game including when he was doing a post-match television interview.Jonevret s tactical plan looked a jumble with holding midfielder Issa Sarr often caught too far forward Oupa Manyisa standing almost on top of left back Patrick Phungwayo out wide and Pirates rarely winning any second ball. I shouted at Sarr for most of the second half to try and get him back said Jonevret betraying a possible lack of grip on his side. But it was not only him. There were many. They wanted so much to do something good out there that they made the easy things difficult and that left us with no chance. We did a lot of stupid things.
