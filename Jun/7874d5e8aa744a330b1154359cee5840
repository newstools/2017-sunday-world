 The eThekwini Municipality on Wednesday hosted a controversial send-off breakfast for Wodumo and rapper Nasty-C both of whom along with rapper AKA are nominated for the BET Awards. The ceremony is being held at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles later this month. They will battle it out in the Best International Act: Africa category with the likes of Nigerian Davido Wizkid and Ghanaian Stonebwoy.Wodumo failed to win in any of the SAMA categories she was nominated in prompting a social media outburst claiming that awards were being bought. In her rant last month she said it was surprising that she could be nominated for international awards yet fail to win a single category at home. It s all behind me now. I m looking forward to this one said the free-speaking dance sensation brushing aside the outburst.Speaking at the breakfast hosted at the Moses Mabhida Stadium the Wololo hit-maker encouraged the eThekwini Municipality to support more artists and local talent. I wish the city can do more for other artists. In fact it should fly other artists to go with us to the US she said.Nasty-C said only that he was grateful to be recognised in the city of his birth. I m grateful and honoured that Durban recognises this talent said the 20-year-old Don t Do It rapper.Deputy mayor Fawzi Peer who was hastily drafted in as mayor Zandile Gumede s replacement said there was nothing wrong with the city organising a send-off for its artists. We have had many partnerships with local artists and brands who have become global brands. Examples include our partnership with the Grammy Award winning Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Sharks rugby team. These are examples of two local brands who continue to fly the Durban flag high through their trade she said.
