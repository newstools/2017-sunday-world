 The Tunisian giants last lost CAF club competition match at home in 2015 during their disappointing Confederation Cup campaign, when they finished the group stages with three defeats on home soil.Last season, the North Africans participated in the Confederation Cup again and despite not reaching the group stages, they were not beaten at home. They are back in the Champions League this season and currently top the group C standings with seven points, thanks to their victories over AS Vita last month and third-placed Sundowns in Atteridgeville a fortnight ago, as well as a draw with St George in between.Downs captain Hlompho Kekana has been inspired by the determination he is seeing from his players in training and hopes this will be transferred onto the pitch, where they need to deliver when it matters most."You can see in the way the boys were training that this is a very important match. We want to win so bad. We are aware that we are in a position where we just need to win so that we can be in a good space."We are in a situation where we really have to test ourselves," said Kekana, who has recovered from a thigh problem which kept him out of the defeat to Esperance."We need to play our own game and hopefully we will win. We now understand the nature and logistics of this tournament. We understand that nothing comes easy. We travel long hours and we wait long hours at the airport. But we are happy that we get to learn these lessons. These are life lessons that nobody can teach you."Key players for Downs will be Percy Tau and Themba Zwane, who both showed recently how much they've grown as players while playing for Bafana. They are both confident and can cause problems for the Esperance defence.
