 The South African duo feature on Major Lazer s latest track Particula with Nasty C kicking off the song with a verse nearly a minute long. The track was released on Thursday and garnered general acclaim from critics worldwide. It was co-produced by Major Lazer and DJ Maphorisa.Speaking to TshisaLIVE DJ Maphorisa said the idea for the track was developed long ago but was cemented during Major Lazer musician Diplo s recent visit to South Africa. Diplo and I have been talking and exchanging ideas over email for a while. Particula has actually existed for almost a year now. I always knew it was a special record and was waiting for the right time to put it out. When Diplo suggested we put it out together as Major Lazer &amp; DJ Maphorisa it was the ideal scenario he said.Diplo fell in love with South Africa during his visit several years ago and returned to these shores most recently in April. He has spoken often about his love for South African music and told The Guardian UK that it was the future of global house music. Well when I go to South Africa and go to a ghetto party the kids there love masters at work and they ll be playing house music but the music they re making is still definitely African as f**k. You can t take that out of the people he said in the interview.DJ Maphorisa agrees and told TshisaLIVE that it was now time for African music to shine. The time for African music and artists is definitely now. The combination of my production and theirs (Major Lazer s) has made it a song that can cross over worldwide but is still truly African he said.Particula also features African artists Ice Prince and Patoranking as well as US-based musician Jidenna.
