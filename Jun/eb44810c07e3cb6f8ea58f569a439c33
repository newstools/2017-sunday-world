 Before stepping into her current role, Mhlongo had cameo roles on the political thriller Ihawu, set to return this month, and on the telenovela Uzalo, both flighted on SABC1.As the submissive but adorable Nandi Mabaso, the wife of Jack Mabaso, a notorious businessman, Mhlongo believes she is here to stay.Despite the songbird's love for music and theatre, she said everything has fallen into place for her on the Mfundi Vundla-created soap opera."I've come to realise I was meant to be on TV. This is my biggest role despite having been exposed to theatre from an early age. I'm going to be around for a long time, depending of course on the writers of the story line. At present I've come out to be one of the leading ladies," she said.Mhlongo, 37, shuttles between Joburg and Durban every weekend after Thursday shoots to visit her family, specifically her husband Edmund and their son.She admitted she is living her soapie character in real life as she is married with three kids, a son and two daughters - one is working in Cape Town and the other is studying at UCT."I've since put my theatre and music career on hold. I used to do corporate gigs, singing Afro pop and jazz while in Durban, and I have toured extensively as Rafiki on the epic Lion King. And being from KwaMashu, it wasn't difficult to be roped in on Uzalo."Mhlongo described Nandi as a typical Zulu woman who respects her husband and loves her kids - daughter Sphe and son Fana. "But she feels guilty because she's not been there for them as she was at a psychiatric clinic all along ..."Mhlongo said she is "an active person" who goes to gym every day .
