 A fellow passenger did give birth at Park Station this morning. Our station staff responded swiftly in both calling for the emergency services and rendering assistance to the mother-to-be said Gautrain spokesperson Kesagee Nayager. The baby was born before the ambulance services arrived and our staff at Park Station did a splendid job assisting with the delivery of the baby. We are very pleased that both the mum and baby are doing well and are in good care. Nayager said it was not yet known where the mother was travelling to when she experienced labour pains.
