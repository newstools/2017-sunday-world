We went to Paputzis as a family first thing this morning with tears in our eyes offering our sincere apologies which (the owner) has kindly accepted. If we had known about this yesterday we would have sorted it out immediately. We apologise to (the owner) and her staff for all the inconvenience caused. Slabber confirmed on Friday afternoon that her father came to apologise to her for his daughter s misdeeds on Friday morning. I accepted the apology. We signed an agreement that she and her partner perform community service at the SPCA for a period of three months. I will then withdraw the charges Slabber said.
