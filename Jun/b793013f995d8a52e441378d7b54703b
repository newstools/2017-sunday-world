 Flex Rabayeezy walked away victorious on Monday night. And while he got love on social media he s already experienced what it s like to fall in the public eye.While on stage for the winner s performance Flex lost his footing and fell. I was just too excited and put my foot where there was no stage. I get really excited when I perform. I really get into the moment and don t see much. I wasn t looking and I fell he told TshisaLIVE.We guess a R250 000 cash prize a record deal and a car is enough to make anything lose their footing. Flex took it in his stride and pulled off a young nae nae. It s not like I fell on my face or anything. I just stumbled and landed on my feet because I used to play soccer and my balance is the sh*t. I kind of straightened myself out and got back on stage. I heard the gasps from the crowd but I was focused on the music Flex told TshisaLIVE.Watch the moment here:
