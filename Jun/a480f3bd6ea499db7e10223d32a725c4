 The girls, aged 16 and 17, were on their way from Mokgalaka Molemole Secondary School when they were offered a lift by two men.Tribal leader Irene Seanego said the two girls, one of whom was her niece, did not come back home that afternoon."We were worried and called the community to help us look for them but we could not find them even at the river where they normally cross on their way to and from school," she said.Seanego said one of the girls called the next morning saying they were in Polokwane where they were later fetched from ."They said that the two men who gave them a lift sprayed them with an unknown substance that made them dizzy. They slept the whole trip and later found themselves in Polokwane without their school bags and cellphones," said Seanego.The matter was not reported to the police."We normally call the community to help us search if children go missing before we inform the police because they normally take long to respond." said Seanego.However, police spokesman Moraka Mphago said they always respond to cases immediately when they are reported."It might be that community members sometimes want to handle cases their own way and that is not advisable. The law requires them to report every criminal incident."The tribal leader laid the blame for the community's problems squarely at the door of the Limpopo department of education.She said the children from her village now have to walk a long distance to school after a school close to their homes was merged with another one further away after the Easter holidays.Mokgalaka Molemole Secondary School was merged with Malebo Secondary School in April, despite parents raising issues about the distance from the village to the school."Our children complain about being mugged of their phones or books all the time. The distance is too long and unsafe," Seanego said.She said the department sent Baltimore circuit manager Eugenius Mashamaite to inform them about the merging of the schools before the Easter break."We told him that parents would not have money to pay for transport. We told him we need help with transport. He promised us that the kids will not go to the other school before the department provided transport but when schools re-opened in April, children were forced to go to the school without transport," Seanego said.Mashamaite told Sunday World that he did not have the power to hire transport."All we do is to collect the number of children in need of scholar transport and submit it to the department for it to provide transport," he said.Parent Maite Matlala said the matter has forced them to pay for transport on rainy days with their social grant money."When it is raining, no one is able to cross the Mogalakwena River. It is dangerous."Limpopo department of education spokesman Dr Naledzani Rasila apologised for the delay in providing scholar transport to the community."We do acknowledge that we have promised the parents at the village transport but unfortunately it has taken long," said Rasila. "The process was delayed by the fact that the contract to get buses had to be advertised."We had to follow procedure in order to get the qualified service provider but we are now at an advanced stage and we might be able to get the buses by the end of the month [June]."
