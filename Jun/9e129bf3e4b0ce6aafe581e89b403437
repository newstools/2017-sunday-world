 The judge on acting talent search show The Final Cut said her courage to campaign against discrimination, especially based on gender, comes from her "youth experience" while working as an actress."I experienced barriers based on matters such as gender, earnings, budget and not being allowed to tell stories except those female-related."Mantsho, 33, one of the leading actresses in the box-office hit movie Happiness is a Four-Letter Word, believes women have the potential to tell men's stories with the same vigour and intensity as their male counterparts.One of her productions that illustrates just how seriously she views matters pertaining to gender in a patriarchal society is the short film The Groom's Price, which interrogates gender and tradition through the practice of lobola."And why is it that males can tell any story while females are restricted to their own?" asked Mantsho.Her much-decorated career dates back to the days of her appearance on popular soapies Generations on SABC1 and e.tv's Scandal! but she has grown to become a producer, director, script and screenwriter, and an online content producer of note."Online shows are disrupting TV in a big way. This is the future and I want to be part of that platform," she said.
