 Stan Ramaila, the Sekhukhune district mayor and his other four officials were elected unopposed.The clique, which comprised Mathabatha supporters, was supposed to have been contested by those who allegedly back former deputy chairman Dickson Masemola to unseat Mathabatha at the party s forthcoming provincial conference which is likely to be moved from Februarynext year to December this year.But they made a U-turn when they discovered they only had 51 delegates over Mathabatha s 237 candidates.Masemola, who is allegedly an ally of Mathabatha s nemisis and provincial secretary Nocks Seabi, could not be reached for comment at the time of going to press.Three senior ANC members, who attended the conference, confirmed the contest was between Mathabatha and Masemola s emissaries and the latter were defeated. It is an indication that Stan still has support in the Sekhukhune region which is his home ground and his victory has actually set the tone for the provincial conference, said a party heavyweight who did not want to be named.Another ANC veteran also confirmed Mathabatha s proxies emerged victorious over Masemola s but cautioned the incumbent s supporters not to be comfortable. The region might have rejected him but it might vote for him at the provincial conference. Remember there is a possibility that Stan might not contest election, said the official.Another ANC official confirmed the outcome of the Sekhukhune region has given Mathabatha fresh hope that he might win provincial conference if he contests. But let s see what happens in other regions before we jump the gun, said the official.By late yesterday Vhembe delegates were still to vote for their preferred chairman between former Thulamela municipal manager Makonde Mathivha and current chair Tshitereke Matibe at a regional conference held at Tshedza Lodge in Makhado yesterday.In the Waterberg conference which will be held before the end of July, the contest has been confirmed to be between the current regional chairperson Morris Mataboge, who is Seabi s ally and Jack Maeko, an ally of Mathabatha.In the Peter Mokaba conference, which will also be held before the end of July, the chairmanship position contest is set to be between incumbent Diwet Monakedi and his deputy John Mpe.In Mopani, the contest is between chairman Seaparo Sekoati and Phalaborwa mayor Pule Shayi.ANC provincial spokeswoman Khumbudzo Ntshavheni confirmed the current Sekhukhune leadership was elected uncontested but declined to comment further. The newly elected chair said the outcome of the conference does not necessarily mean the region is united, the leadership must rise up and unite the organisation, she said.
