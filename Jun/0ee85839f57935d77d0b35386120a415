 T-Munny, born Thabiso Ngobese, has already recorded songs with American artist Chappel and British vocalist Harriet Summer.He described his music as fusing Afro beats, electronic and heavy base.Ngobese, 28, of Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal said the songs he recorded with the international artists will be part of his upcoming seven-track EP."My aim is to invade the international market because they enjoy this kind of music."Before jumping borders, he had his fair share of working with prominent local artists like DJs Tira, Cindo, Vinny Da Vinci and Fistaz Mixwell.He said his first break was when he accompanied a friend to drop a demo at DJ Tira's studios."He didn't like my friend's music but when he listened to mine he loved it and from then we worked together," he said.He said while studying IT at the Durban University of Technology, he started attending the South African Music Conferences."They would have a demo listening sessions competition and for two consecutive years - 2009 and 2010 - I won the best producer. My music career started gaining momentum and my school work was suffering. So I dropped out," he said.He now has his own record label called Invaders Music.
