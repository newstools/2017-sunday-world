 Pirates will go into their clash with Matsatsantsa a Pitori on Saturday at Moses Mabhida Stadium having last played a competitive match on May 27 against Golden Arrows.In contrast SuperSport have been busy in the Caf Confederation Cup visiting TP Mazembe in Lubumbashi on June 3 before hosting them in Atteridgeville on Tuesday four days before the final. I don t think that it s going to help us or count against us Manyisa said. We are professional players. We had to train very hard preparing for this game. On Saturday it won t be about them playing in the Caf Confederation Cup and us not playing. I don t think that they will be fitter than us. We will see on Saturday. We have been playing some friendly games and playing against each other at training. We feel good because we know what we want and what we are up against.
