 Unathi had fans in a frenzy last month when she told Gareth Cliff on his CliffCentral radio show that she felt like her ancestors had been calling her to fulfil a spiritual calling. a comment that many thought the musician was on the path to becoming a traditional healer.Speaking to Drum Unathi denied this and said that she had been misunderstood. I m not becoming a traditional healer she said adamantly.She explained that she had been approached by a stranger in 2006 and told that she was born a healer and would one day heal with music. A prediction she claimed had been repeated by several other spiritual leaders since. She refused to rule out the possibility of one day healing with more than just music. I ve learnt that I have a healing ability and I ve been told that I will heal through songs for now. Later on it might be through visions and other things because the spiritual realm evolves she explained.Attempts to contact Unathi for comment were unsuccessful.
