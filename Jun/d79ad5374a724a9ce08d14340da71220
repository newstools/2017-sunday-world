 The Olympic 400m champion slashed four-hundredths of a second off the American legend s 30.85sec mark as he cantered to victory by nearly a second.His 30.81 obliterated Usain Bolt s 30.97 meet record. It was a nervy buildup obviously because I ve been avoiding the 300s and 400s so I m glad I finally got to break through that said Van Niekerk who races his first international 400m in Switzerland on Thursday next week. It s a good step towards the 400m in Lausanne and I m feeling quite positive and confident and let s see how it goes. I think we ve got to keep on working and keep on improving added Van Niekerk who is based in Gemona Italy during the European summer.
