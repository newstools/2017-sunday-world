"I went to so many auditions I didn't even know if I was still auditioning for Zamani"Zamani Mbatha, 19, said even though he was subjected to about 10 auditions for the role, he did not know if he got the part or not."I went to so many auditions I didn't even know if I was still auditioning for Zamani or something else," he said.He said his sister prepared him for anything when she told him never to be sure of the role until he signs a contract.Before he went to his first audition in Durban for the role, Mbatha said he had just matriculated and did not know what he wanted to do with his life."I then prayed to God to show me the direction I should take with my life, and I am glad He answered me."About his character, he said he believes he shares some of the traits and have similarities more than differences.He said: "Firstly, we share the same name, we are both career-driven, we love family and we are humble."He said when he started he struggled with his character but eventually got to know him (Zamani) through the help of the production team.The young actor said he had been getting positive feedback, to which his sister told him not to be too comfortable with. "The feedback from the public and industry people pushes me to work even harder."He said growing up, acting never even crossed his mind, but now he knows it is something he wants to pursue.
