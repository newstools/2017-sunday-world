We are delighted to welcome MTN as our new headline Springbok sponsor said Roux. They proudly carry millions of calls across the continent every day and we re proud to carry their name on our jerseys. From the very first conversation we had with them they saw the power and potential of a partnership with the Springboks and SA Rugby way beyond placing a logo on a sportsman s playing kit. They understand where we are as a sport and they want to partner with us in that journey of inspiring the nation. It has been a tough couple of years from a financial perspective for SA Rugby and our challenges certainly remain. But this partnership marks the crossing of a watershed for SA Rugby.
