 The theme this year is "Colour of Magic". But who will reign majestic and who will be a clown remains to be seen.Metro FM presenter Lerato Kganyago said she did not know what she will be wearing on the day, but it will be something by designers Quiteria Kekana and George Malelu's Quiteria &amp; George brand."I am definitely going, but I cannot tell you exactly what I will be wearing because we are still working on it," she said.These have been the go-to designers for the last three years for A-list celebs like Boity Thulo. Kganyago always looks ravishing in their garments.Presenter and actress Ayanda Thabethe, who will be the face of The Opulent Experience marque, is also not certain who will bedazzle her booty."I am still deciding on who would dress me but I promise I will look good," she said.The self-proclaimed Queen of the Red Carpet, Skolopad, said her naked tactics will be under more control this time around.For those wanting to see her famous butt tattoo, she humbly apologised.She said she wants to dress up like the queen that she is."I am not going to be showing too much flesh but I promise you I am still going to get the attention, raunchy but in a way that shows class," she said.Fashion designer Sello Medupe of the Scalo brand said he will be dressing singer LeAnne Dlamini and reality TV star Blue Mbombo.But he refused to divulge more details."Their dresses will be mind-blowing. We are going to be taking this fashion thing to the next level," he said.Paledi Segapo, creative director of Palse, was hesitant to reveal the stars he will be dressing because "they had not paid yet".He said there are no rules to dressing a certain way, noting anything works."People need to push the envelope. The big no-no however is anything that looks gimmicky ... stage costumes and badly designed apparel should not even see daylight," he said.He advised those who are going to choose a colour and run with it not to be scared to experiment with colours out of their comfort zone. But he warned not to indulge in the colour as it's always overdone.He said the trending colours since it is winter are olive green, burgundy and mint green."Jeans are not considered fashionable at this event. Half-nudes costumes look tacky and resemble no class. And no golf T-shirts paired with blazers."
