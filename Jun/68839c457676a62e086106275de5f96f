 Ahead of the launch of his tell-all book on Wednesday Sowetan published a tasty excerpt from the autobiography in which Somizi recounts the experience.In it Somizi explains that on the day of his father s burial he shared a bed with a popular musician and his girlfriend. He recounted the feelings he had as he and the musician fondled . My heart throbbing and loins on fire the scent of a man and the prickly hairy legs fired me up. We fondled. I was actually the one touching him and he touched me back sending me into a tizz of ecstasy he explained.Somizi has previously spoken about his sexuality telling Sunday World that he knew he was not straight when he fathered his now 22-year-old daughter. When I fathered a child I already knew I was not a straight guy. I did everything knowing very well I was gay. I could have been bisexual but definitely not straight.
