 Tissen and Dyer clash at Emperors Palace on Saturday evening. The fight is one of Golden Gloves' five-bout card which will be headlined by an ABU cruiserweight clash between Thabiso Mchunu and Johnny Muller."I am prepared to put my house up. A lot of people are undermining Alfonso. Some regard him as a boy based from what they know about him three years ago. He is a man now and proved that by winning the ABU middleweight title via a second-round knockout [against Xolani Mvubu] in March. I predict a stoppage win for Alfonso in later rounds," said Strydom.He said they will go into the fight as underdogs based on the fact that Dyer is the reigning SA champion."We also know that some people don't think Alfonso will be strong in the super middleweight since he will be fighting for the first time in that weight division," added Strydom.Tissen has 10 wins, a loss and a draw, while Dyer has seven wins, three losses and a draw.
