 The 23-year-old who has been cooking for little over a year has been doing self-marketing on social media for while now.But on Thursday night Luyanda got a major breakthrough when she won a challenge that Cassper Nyovest set up. It s not just Twitter it s a place that can make your dreams come true if you are strategic about it. I have been pushing my brand for a while but I realised that Cassper will bring greater exposure for me and a bonus if I win him over with my food Luyanda said.The young chef wants to impress Cassper Nyovest with hopes that she may even end up as his personal chef .She asked the rapper for the opportunity to cook for him and he responded with a challenge for her to get 10 000 retweets.Luyanda accepted the challenge and got over 10k retweets in a day. Now she is preparing an incredible menu which she shared with TshisaLIVE. Some of the meals might change but for now I am thinking of a healthy yet hearty menu to accommodate his healthy lifestyle. I will also incorporate some things I know he may like C ROC in the dessert. The proof will be in the tasting. Hopefully Cassper will share his thoughts she said.Starter: Tomato tart tart with roasted tomatoes tomato jam ricotta cheese and basilMain: Roasted baby chicken sherry gravy honey glazed vegetables and fondant potatoesDessert: C ROC Cr me br l e
