 I started rehearsing waking up early. I wanted to see how much I press the snooze button. I don t know what an early Tumi s brain does she said in an exclusive interview with TshisaLIVE the day before the big announcement was made.Tumi is with her co-anchor Martin Bester and although they re going to be seeing each other every morning in just a few weeks they hardly knew each other prior to the announcement. I watched one of her shows and when my friends and I left the sentiment was the same she was great said Martin.So he clearly wasn t a fan of Our Perfect Wedding?Martin skids past the question and instead focused on Tumi and her current achievements. I m excited for her new show. And this adventure. I believe we re putting together an offering that no other radio station can match. It s a strong statement considering they re going up against big names including DJ Fresh and Somizi on Metro FM and Anele Mdoda on 947 for a bite of the morning omelette.Tumi is confident about it. She s not just doing the pr speech that s expected of her even though there s someone from the Jacaranda marketing team listening in on the interview. This is my next big thing. We aren t going on air to compete with anyone. Our people are our voice and we are going to represent every South African out there. I m serious. This is a fantastic platform and I m ready. So are we. So are we.
