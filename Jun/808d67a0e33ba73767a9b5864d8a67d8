 Butler, who lost to Bafana Bafana in last year's Cosafa Cup final, will take over from Cavin Johnson. At the time of going to print, Stars had not made an official announcement, but Sowetan had been reliably informed of his appointment.It's a surprise call from Stars, who are still involved in the CAF Confederation Cup group stages. Besides reaching the Cosafa Cup final, Butler has done little to help improve the Botswana national team.Botswana missed out on qualifying for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, as they finished third in the group behind Burkina Faso and Uganda. Zebras' current campaign started with a loss to Mauritania and he was quoted by Botswana's news website The Monitor as saying some people in the country's FA are sabotaging the team.His man-management skills have been questioned by journalists in Botswana, and he is said to be hostile towards the media when things are not going well. The Englishman's coaching career started in 2000 at Halifax Town, in England's fifth-tier Football League. He later worked in Australia, Singapore and Thailand.Stars' general manager Senzo Mazingiza said they had interviewed Butler, but he had not been appointed yet."Yes, we had an interview with Peter Butler and another coach from Tanzania. I am not going to deny that we've interviewed him, but I would not say we've appointed him. As soon as something [regarding a coach] is done, we'll make an announcement," he said.
