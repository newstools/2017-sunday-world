 During an interview with TshisaLIVE Tina shared the number one item on her actor s wish list is to work closely with Sello again.She explained that their Generations days were etched deeply in her memory and the calibre of Sello s acting brought out the best in her. If there is someone I would love to share a storyline with it is without a doubt Sello. That man challenged me and made me get to levels I wasn t sure I was capable of. I don t even think people expected us to be that fire we became she said.Tina s sentiments were echoed by Sello when he was asked by Anele on Real Talk with Anele who is the one actor who made him better.Sello said she is one actress that took out the best out of me. When you are with her you never know where she s gonna go and that is what makes her a great performer .The actress told TshisaLIVE that the pair haven t worked together since the Generation days which was a little over two decades ago. She said although there had been chances over the years they have failed to co-ordinate their busy schedules. I can t put into words how much Sello has inspired me and I can t wait for the day when we work together again. I believe we are not done someone out there has to bring us back together she said.Tina Jaxa has long become a household name having acted in some of Mzansi s most popular shows including Isidingo e.tv sitcom Madam &amp; Eve and her iconic role as Priscilla Mthembu in Generations with Sello as Archie Moroka.
