 The video won big at the 2017 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in France on Wednesday evening.One Source won two silvers and one gold award in the Entertainment categories at the prestigious ceremony held each year to honour the finest creative projects from around the world.The wins came four months after Khuli launched a scathing attack against Metro FM Awards judges for not choosing the video as Music Video of the Year. It was a disappointment that repeated itself at the annual South African Music Awards (SAMAs) a few months later.Speaking to TshisaLIVE from Cannes on Thursday Khuli said that it cut deep to not get recognition at home . I believe that God has bigger plans for me. I didn t win a SAMA or Metro FM Award but I scooped a gold (award) at the Cannes Lions on a global stage out of 43 000 entries that is huge! I now realise that I wasn t created to live a small life with small goals and dreams he added.Khuli said he hoped the win would inspire other South African artists to work hard even if they are not recognised by the local music industry. We need to stop creating for local and think global. I met some interesting creatives from all over the world and I m truly inspired by how they think. I m ready to make that transition and take over the world he said.At the glitzy awards ceremony Khuli also took part in a presentation about the music video which features African artists Sarkodie Victoria Kimani VVIP and Patoranking.
