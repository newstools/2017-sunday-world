 The chairman has wasted no time in getting new recruits to strengthen coach Dan Malesela's squad, announcing the signing of Kurt Lentjies and Puleng Tlolane.Both have a wealth of experience, with Lentjies having captained Maritzburg United, while Tlolane arrives from Polokwane City.The chairman also hinted at the possible return of former Chippa captain James Okwuosa, who was sold to Orlando Pirates early this year."At Chippa we are busy signing players that we think are needed in the team," Mpengesi said. "We are also working on strengthening our technical team in terms of getting coach Dan Malesela an experienced assistant coach and a proper structure."Even though we have not officially announced it, we already have clinched contracts with two new players in Kurt Lentjies and Puleng Tlolane. There are also other players I will announce soon."Chippa supporters have been questioning if my decision to let James Okwuosa join Orlando Pirates was correct."James only played one game for Pirates. He is still contracted to them but he has been calling us pleading with us to talk with Pirates to bring him back. Those are some of the things that I have been working on."Asked about the future of Mbuyiselo Sambu, who was Malesela's assistant coach last season, the chairman said the former defender will still be part of the team but would probably join Chippa's MultiChoice Diski Challenge side."Sambu is going nowhere. However, he still has much to learn."For the time being we will deploy him to the MDC side to learn."
