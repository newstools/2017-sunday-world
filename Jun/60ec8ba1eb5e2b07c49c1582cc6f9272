The university went through an open tender process twice.Bosch filed papers in the Pretoria-based court in which she is accusing the university of awarding the tender to Varsity Village, Zamani CC and Vanguard Real Estate, allegedly without following proper procedures.She applied for an urgent court interdict to stop the university from awarding the trio the contract but her application was dismissed with costs as the judge said the matter was not urgent.In the papers, where Bosch's company Amohelang Holdings is cited as the applicant, the revered tycoon claims the university awarded the tender to the companies through corrupt means and pleaded with the court to terminate it.Bosch alleged the companies did not qualify for the tender as they did not attend the briefing sessions as stipulated in the advertised bid requirements.She also alleged the companies charged R32000 per student a year in accommodation fees compared to R22000 she wanted to charge."It is unfortunate, as these amounts must be recovered by TUT from the poor students who already find the cost of education very high and unaffordable," she said.She said she also discovered that her company was not considered as the incorrect zoning certificate and certificate of compliance were erroneously submitted in their bid."[But] the tenders submitted by Vanguard and Varsity Village also do not contain the necessary zoning certificate and certificate of compliance."Bosch told the court that she learnt that the two companies were appointed through a deviation process."If Vanguard and Varsity Village were accommodated through a deviation process, that deviation must be fair, reasonable and confined to certain limits."It must be exercised under utmost pressing circumstances to address a situation that was not foreseen."TUT spokeswoman Willa de Ruyter refuted Bosch's claims."The university went through an open tender process twice, which did not yield positive results," she said."In view of the urgent need for accommodation in Polokwane, approval, in line with the approved TUT tender policies and procedures for a deviation, was granted."A third round then commenced to invite service providers to submit tenders within the framework of the approved deviated process as well as relaxing conditions of ownership."This deviated process allowed potential service providers to submit tenders. After a physical walkabout by dedicated teams to identify possible service providers, a formal one-on-one briefing session was held with them on the possibility to submit tenders within a seven-day period."The teams also provided them with all the documentation needed to complete their tender submissions. In view of this, the tender was awarded to three companies, without favour or preference.'
