We must make it clear that Cavin wasn t fired it is his contract that was not renewed. So we will be sounding him out he added.Stars players were given time off when they arrived back home from Tunisia on Tuesday and will get back to work next week to prepare for the return clash.Like Mamelodi Sundowns and SuperSport United who are also involved in post-season African club competition Stars are trying to juggle giving their players time off with participation in the Confederation Cup and then also having proper pre-season preparations. It is a difficult situation Mazingiza admitted. There will be another short break for the players in July and then it will be back to work again.
