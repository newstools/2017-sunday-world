 Noluthando Gwala, a communications officer in The Presidency, has obtained a protection order against Cheratidzo Accelliah Muyendizi Makombe-Ngcobo at the Protea Magistrate's Court in Soweto after Makombe-Ngcobo accused her of wrecking her marriage to Bafana Theo Ngcobo.The case was struck off the roll when the two appeared in court on Monday after the court discovered it did not have jurisdiction over the matter as Gwala was not a Soweto resident.She was told to reapply for the order at the Pretoria Magistrate's Court where she lives.On the other hand, Makombe-Ngcobo opened a case of trespassing and malicious damage to property against Gwala at Gallo Manor police station on Tuesday, but the case was transferred to the Sandton police station.This after she accused Gwala of coming to her Buccleuch house uninvited and breaking one of the windows in one of their discords over Ngcobo.Attempts to solicit comments from both Ngcobo and Gwala drew a blank this week.A justice department official who did not want to be named said Gwala alleged in her papers that Makombe-Ngcobo bullied her and called her a "whore", "prostitute", and a "slut that sucks a dick of a 70- year-old man" on social media."Noluthando also alleged that Cheratidzo threatened to kill her, and as a result she is suffering from migraines and panic attacks," said the official.Makombe-Ngcobo said: "I didn't do any of those things she alleges in the interim protection order against me. I was trying to reach out to her; to have a woman-on-woman talk after discovering that she was my husband's mistress."She said she would leave him alone. The next thing she rocks up at my work with my husband and the police to serve me with the order."Makombe-Ngcobo alleged that a few days after obtaining the order, Gwala arrived at her house in the evening with unknown people and broke her window and challenged her to come out so they could fight."I didn't go out," she said.
