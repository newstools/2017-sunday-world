 Bob took a trip down memory lane to his childhood during an interview with Gareth Cliff on Cliff Central.He said his mother died when he was just 11 years old and after a few calculations he found that his father was a Ben 10 . I did the numbers and I found out that my father was a Ben 10 and it kind of made sense why the relationship was so volatile. It was really one of those Mr and Mrs Smith relationships he said.The radio personality further explained that he made the observation of how his father enjoyed being macho because he dated an older woman and his mother was somewhat annoyed that she loved a younger man. They hated to love each other and I think she (mom) was really miffed at the fact that she really liked this young guy and he had this bravado thing this macho thing that he could bed an older woman than him who had gone further to school than he had he said.
