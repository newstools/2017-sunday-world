Ensure that there are heaters, fireplaces, warm drinks and even small blankets for guests. Winter is not exactly wedding season locally (in South Africa), but there is an upside to it - plenty bargains from suppliers. Negotiating is key.But if the main event is not executed exceptionally, your vows will be hitting the brakes long before you reach your destination.With summer under the belt with its bright hues, winter weddings welcome dark but bold colours as a taster for a warm marriage.According to expert Colin Cowie - the international wedding planner for many stars - and local Ntombi Nhlapo from Extravaganza Weddings &amp; Events, trendy colours to consider are jewel tones, navy blue and white, black and white and even various shades of grey."Of course, the 'it' colour at the moment [is] Burgundy and berries," said Cowie.Originally born in South Africa, Cowie is a sought-after wedding planner in New York.The lifestyle guru and events planner for many stars, the TV personality and writer leads a remarkable life with an impressive list of clientele including Jennifer Aniston, Tom Cruise, Jennifer Lopez, Oprah Winfrey and Kim Kardashian.He has been at the forefront of events and wedding planning for the past 25 years.Time and time again he raises the bar and creates trends for mind-blowing guest experiences.

Attention to detail and customisation for clients is a must," said Cowie.He said when planning a wedding, come up with a big picture, add shape, identity and a colour scheme."Create mood boards and use Pinterest and Instagram. Be articulate."Wooden elements are classic winter trends. Think wooden welcome signs, or wood serving plates.Think outside the box. Forestry design features perfectly reflect the changing season.He said when it came to centre piece ideas, which can be every bride's nightmare, just go with flowers if all else fails.Having as many flowers as possible adds that feminine touch - the wedding is more about the bride and her beauty anyway.He said another way to get creative is to pair up greenery and fruit."It gives that natural touch. Foliage in forest greens and mustard is also all the craze this year."For added drama, mirrors can give a rustic look [or] a luxe finish. It is all about the guest experience; perfection must be at its best," said Cowie.Nhlapo gave the lowdown on exactly what it takes to plan a wedding in South Africa.Being in the industry for a long time has allowed her to experience all there is.The 28-year-old said she loves the industry and hosts a wedding segment with Khali de Villiers from SA School of Weddings on online radio station Cliff Central.She said winter weddings were risky because nobody likes the cold.But if you're a bride willing to take the risk, these tips and tricks will ensure a winter wonderland, glitch-free."Winter is not exactly wedding season locally, but there is an upside to it - plenty bargains from suppliers. Negotiating is key," said Nhlapo.She advises that the venue should ideally be indoors."Ensure that there are heaters, fireplaces, warm drinks and even small blankets for guests."We are blessed with South African weather but a safe time for guests to be outside is between 10.30am and 4.30pm. Anything after that is a no-no," said Nhlapo.Trends on the decor side are textures such as soft velvets and faux fur that will give your wedding that pure luxe feel.Greenery is also more cost- effective, as opposed to flowers.When it comes to make-up trends, wedding glow on the big day is a must.She said brides must ensure that they moisturise accordingly because winter has a drying effect on the skin."Go for a dewy finish, so cream blushers are ideal. Keep the look natural," says Nhlapo.She added that when it comes to the show-stopper - which is the wedding dress - add sleeves with delicate lace and beads to fit the style of the dress.Boleros and faux fur capes as cover-ups are still all the rage too, if the weather takes a turn for the worst.When it comes to colours - nudes under white lace, traditional crisp white, off-white, ivory, light grey and golden tones are a big hit.While summer had dramatic dress shapes, winter is all about going back to basics according to bridal trends.Intricate beading, tiers, bows, soft lace and frothy tulles are modern again.Bridal Fashion Week also showed off newer designs in ruffles, feathers, Ballgowns, a-line silhouettes, modern column dresses and bohemian sheaths, cascading ruffles and fully tiered skirts.Sleeves were all the focus with flutter sleeve styles and billowing bishop sleeves.Summer shoulders are gone, now its time to cover up in lace.New winter trend dresses are feather accents - although they can be itchy. And two-piece wedding dresses - princess skirts and intricately designed tops.In terms of accessories, go big and bold with earrings.Tiaras fit for a princess are back and florals for autumn are ground-breaking.Think floral earrings and hair pieces.Metallic everything is also well on trend, think jewellery, shoes and even decor.Naked wedding cakes are literally what they say.No fancy fondants and trimmings.It gives off a rustic and forest feel.It can be cheaper on the pocket too.Here are more ideas from Pinterest:Cable knit cakes, which are white on white and literally looks like a cable knit jersey, simplistic but elegant.Burgundy coloured cakes with embossed prints and a lace effect also speak of a royal winter wedding.Wine-coloured wild dahlias are the hottest flowers for autumn and winter weddings.Succulents, acacia, and Brazilian berries are also popular. Red roses with green shrubbery work well.You could also make your own bouquet of flowers using newspaper or veld materials for a real rustic look.
