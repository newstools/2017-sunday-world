 It is a classic case of like father, like son for the veteran actor and his son Lerato, who is determined to follow in his daddy's big footsteps.Jerry vowed that no child of his would be involved in the entertainment world. But the universe had plans of its own and Jerry could only ignore Lerato's talents for so long."I really feared for him. This industry can be unkind, especially to young artists," says Jerry.Lerato, 30, is a musician and actor. He has acted in numerous dramas and has played as a session musician for some of the country's most respected artists.This year, Lerato has spread his wings as a solo musician and releases his single this month, to be followed by an album next year.Meanwhile, Jerry has made his return on the e.tv drama Scandal! as Neo Mokhethi, better known as Moscow.The return of this character also comes at a time when the legendary actor just discovered his identity as a Makhetha."I was born into and got raised by the Mofokeng family. They contributed greatly to what I am today."But there was an unease within me on my identity. It is critical for a man to know his true identity as it filters down to many generations to come," he explains about his recent acceptance of his father's surname.He says in December 2015 his father's identity was revealed to him by someone also raised by his father, Dan Makhetha."The Makhetha family has fully embraced me and I am thrilled and feel affirmed by them. So I am Jerry Mofokeng wa Makhetha."This is a story of a father who has supported his children in pursuing their dreams against all odds, encouraging them to be the best that they can be.Lerato says he was bitten by the music bug first and had no idea that he was going to be an actor, let alone alongside his famous father."I was nine years old when I decided that I wanted to get into music," he says.As a result, his father took him to study at the Drakensberg Boys Choir School and later the National School of the Arts in Joburg."When I was about 15 years old in high school I lead the choir, which I guess showed my dad that I'm talented," he says.After his days in the boys choir, which won provincial competitions, he then decided to rap and produce R&amp;B music in 2007."Hip-hop gave me a change to start something new, and considering that I play piano, I wanted to produce something unique at the time," he says.He says he produced for rappers including Tuks Senganga and HHP and worked as a session musician for Unathi and Kabomo.dHis dad roped him into the Brenda Fassie musical, titled MA-BRRR: The Musical , which premiered at the Vereeniging Civic Theatre in 2010."He brought me in to produce some music for the show and also do some sounds for the performers," he says.Things took a different turn when one of the main actors did not pitch on the opening night."Since I was part of the whole thing from the rehearsals, my pops asked me to play the lead alongside him."He says that was the turning point in his life because he admired actors but never thought he could do it."It was a big night and I was very nervous but my dad kept me calm, and looking back I would say that was the best performance of my life," he says."I guess a couple of directors liked me after that and I was featured on a series eKasi Our Stories: Chicken Murder, playing the character Chicken Murder," he laughs.He also went on to be a director on e.tv's drama series Umlilo.Jerry is proud, like any father would be, but says at first he didn't encourage him to be an actor but soon realised that Lerato had talent."Who am I to deny God's DNA and what it wants. I'm happy about the boy's successes. I am very glad that he took my advice about the industry. I told him to never be big-headed and always respect his craft," he says.Jerry has appeared in a number of critically acclaimed films including Cry The Beloved Country, Lord Of War, Mandela and De Klerk, and the 2005 Academy Award-winning film Tsotsi.He acted in community theatre during the turbulent years of the student unrest and proceeded to Wits Drama School and Columbia University in the US, where he obtained his masters degree in theatre directing.In the 1990s he went through an eclectic career, from teaching at his alma mater, Wits, to being an associate artistic director at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre, chief director of the Mpumalanga department of sports and culture, and finally artistic director of the State Theatre in Pretoria.He was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for Acting at the 7th annual South African Film and Television Awards in 2013.His advice to parents, especially fathers - allow your children to follow their dreams, even if they mirror your path.
