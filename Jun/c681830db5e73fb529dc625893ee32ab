 Speaking to TshisaLIVE at the launch of Somizi s memoir Dominoes: Unbreakable Spirit in Johannesburg on Wednesday Cassper said he had spoken to Boity about the rumours but was just as confused as everyone else. I asked her about it but she wouldn t tell me anything. She was like it s none of your business . I m not heartbroken because we are really good friends. I don t think that it s her boyfriend but if it is good for her. If she s happy I am happy Cassper said.He said that Boity had a lot of great things to say about the Congolese basketball player Christian Eyenga with whom she has been linked.Cassper s only wish is that her new partner will treat her well. If that s her boyfriend I hope he s a good guy. She s been through a lot and she deserves a good guy. I just didn t deserve her Cassper added.
