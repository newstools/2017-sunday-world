 The former Ajax Amsterdam Porto Blackburn Rovers and West Ham striker has replaced Eric Tinkler who joined SuperSport United last week.With Tinkler having steered the side to a creditable third place in their maiden Premier Soccer League season alongside their Telkom Knockout Cup triumph and their MTN8 semi-final placing McCarthy has big boots to fill.The 39-year-old Capetonian is making a home-coming of sorts with his playing career having started in the Mother City before globetrotting in what was a successful playing career that included 80 Bafana caps and the UEFA Champions League winners medal he earned with Porto in the 2003/04.It remains to be seen whether John Comitis s gamble on McCarthy will pay off because the all-time leading Bafana Bafana goalscorer has never taken on a head coaching gig.While he is a suitably qualified candidate with a UEFA A licence the jury is out on whether he can transfer his on-field skills into something tangible from a management perspective.
