 The two murder cases were reported to police two weeks ago and three women have been arrested - one for murder and two others for kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice and murder.Spokesman for the police Mohlaume Mamabolo confirmed the two cases."Two women were arrested for kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice and murder of a lady who was dating one of the lady's boyfriends."In another case, we can confirm that a lady was also arrested for stabbing to death her boyfriend's lover a week ago," said Mamabolo.The incident that shocked Alexandra township was the gruesome murder of Lindiwe Masuku, who was reported missing last November .Masuku was allegedly kidnapped by her boyfriend's ex-lover and her friend outside her home in the township, where she lived with him.She was never seen again and her body was only discovered by police last month, burnt beyond recognition and buried in a shallow grave in Rustenburg, North West.Police were allegedly led to the body by both the suspect and her friend after the ex-girlfriend was questioned.According to a police statement seen by Sunday World, the two suspects told police how Masuku was kidnapped in Alexandra and later killed in City Deep, Joburg.It emerged that the body was then taken to Rustenburg where it was put in a shallow grave and burned.Masuku's boyfriend Vusumuzi Nkosi said: "Yes, I can confirm that my ex-girlfriend has been arrested for the murder of my girlfriend, but due to police investigations I can't comment further."The second murder happened last week when Nompumelelo Nkosi was stabbed to death a few metres from her home, allegedly by her boyfriend's other girlfriend.According to a statement deposed by the boyfriend, Stanley Moeketsi, 27, Nkosi's love rival walked in on the couple in his room in the backyard."She asked, 'Is this the person you are [now] with?' and then took a knife out of a drawer and stabbed me in the chest."I tried to fight back, grabbed her but we both fell. She then stabbed me in the legs ..."I told Mpumi (Nompumelelo) to flee. As I lay down, she followed Mpumi outside and stabbed her," Moeketsi said in his statement to the police.He was later taken to Edenvale Hospital.But upon being discharged, the community wanted to kill him, saying he was the one who caused the whole situation by bringing Nkosi to his room knowing well that he was still dating the suspect.He said before the incident, he and Nkosi had attended a party in Soweto and he asked her to spend the night with him at his place since his other girlfriend had arranged to sleep over at a friend's place."I was surprised to see her back. I didn't expect things to turn out the way they did," said Moeketsi.Nkosi's family said her alleged attacker was notorious in the area for her prowess with a knife - often using it in fights.Nkosi's older sister Ntombenhle called for a lengthy jail sentence for the murder.Ntombenhle said the suspect was previously arrested after stabbing another woman but spent only three days in police custody."We just want the police to do their job and make sure that this time she does not spend only a few days in police cells," she said. "She must get more than 10 years for what she did to my sister."Nkosi was buried last Saturday.
