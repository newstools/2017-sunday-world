 Dikwena are at the bottom of Group B with one point, five behind leaders CS Sfaxien.Dikwena host the side from Tunisia at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace tonight (7pm). Senne believes a win against Sfaxien will revive their aspirations of making a mark on the continent."We haven't lost hope and focus. Our minds are on winning the game. If we win on Wednesday, we will still have a chance to progress in the competition. We are playing the number one team, which has just six points. A win will do us good," Senne told Platinumstars.com."We know that it's not going to be easy. We have to attack. We are not going to defend at home. We can't give them a chance. In Tunisia, we panicked a bit. We can't afford to make the same mistakes at home. I am confident that we can win the game."Senne got promoted at the beginning of the season. The 23-year-old is keen to make his time on the pitch count."I would like to play a lot of games. I have to score goals to show my hunger. I have to show that I have always wanted to play in the PSL. I want to play for the national team one day. Then I would say I have achieved what I wanted in football," said Senne.He knows, he has to work on certain aspects of his game."I need to work on my ball retention because I lose balls sometimes. As a winger, I also need to work on my technique and deliver quality crosses."
