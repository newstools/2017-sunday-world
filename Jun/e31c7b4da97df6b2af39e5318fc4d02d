 The sexy starlet joined the soapie two years ago after Omuhle Gela, who used to play the character, left the popular SABC2 soapie."Busi was fired from Muvhango, we don't know the reasons but the thing is they don't tell actors when they are ending their roles."So she found out a day before her last scene that she was dying on the show," a Muvhango staffer who declined to be named said.The staffer said that the star was devastated and approached production about this but no one was willing to talk to her.Sithole, 21, and her management, Legends agency, did not reply to questions sent to them by the time of going to print.
