 The Vodacom Change the World programme was introduced in 2011, giving individuals the opportunity to volunteer their time and skills to work for a NPO for a period of 12 months. To date, 111 volunteers have already made a difference working with a wide range of NPOs.This year s programme will focus on affording young graduates with volunteerism opportunities and real work experience while promoting the culture and spirit of volunteerism.The country s skills development remains a challenge while the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high. In an attempt to help address this challenge, Vodacom Foundation is set to help empower young people through the Vodacom Change the World programme. Through this programme, volunteers are afforded a unique opportunity to do something close to their heart, while imparting their skills to help society. The programme continues to go from strength to strength as it touches the lives of ordinary South Africans.
