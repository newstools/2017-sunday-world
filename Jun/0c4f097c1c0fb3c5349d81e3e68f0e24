 The Times Media Group has filed an urgent application seeking the court to rescind the order it gave last month which barred the media from reporting on the bail application.The order which was handed down by Magistrate Carlo Labuschagne permitted the media to report only on the judgment on the bail application.Both the state and defence had called for the media blackout claiming sensitive information would be revealed.They submitted that the investigation was still at a crucial stage.The defence had stated that they did not want a trial through the media.Lindi Nkosi-Thomas for the National Director of Public Prosecutions on Friday requested a postponement to address the latest application by Times Media.She and Sandile Mantsoe s lawyers wanted to prepare affidavits to oppose the application.The application by Times Media Group has highlighted the importance of freedom of speech and public interest in the matter. Labuschagne postponed the matter to 23 June for further arguments.Both Mantsoe and the NDPP are to file their affidavits by June 16 while the Times Media Group would need to file a responding affidavit by June 21.Mantsoe who faces charges of premeditated murder and defeating the ends of justice looked around the court and spotted his family who had bundled up on the right of the court gallery. Among those present to support him were his pastor and brother.He was arrested after charred remains found in Lyndhurst were matched to his missing girlfriend Karabo Mokoena.She had been reported missing on April 28 and her pictures circulated on social media.Mokoena s uncle later took to Facebook and wrote that she had been found and her boyfriend had confessed to killing and burning her.Labuschagne told Mantsoe that he would need to finalise the media s motion before addressing his bail application.
