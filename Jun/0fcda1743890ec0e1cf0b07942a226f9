 The rapper told Slikour Onlife he always knew he doesn t belong here and he has accepted that rappers here [Johannesburg] will never like or respect him. I think it s a Maftown mindset. The first day you come to Johannesburg you know you don t belong here. You know the stories and the type of people you are going to meet. I came here already like I don t belong here . I knew these guys will never like or respect me because I rap in vernac and I m from a small town... I don t relate to these guys he said.The rapper claimed that he almost fell into the trap of becoming a villain but luckily saw the error in his ways. These Jo burg dudes literally and genuinely think they are the are the sh*t. It s really deep. I used to think that behind close doors they would acknowledge that I ve changed the game but I have come to realise that its actually not like that and its cool. They still think I m a fluke and I m okay with that he said.Cassper released his third studio album Thuto in May and has received general acclaim.
