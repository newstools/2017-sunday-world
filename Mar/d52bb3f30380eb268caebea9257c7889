 Faa-iqah Hartley has made inroads in women's soccer as a talented midfielder, like her father who played in the Olympics in 2000 and bagged five caps for Bafana Bafana.Hartley, 18, caught the eye of University of Johannesburg scouts while she was only 15 and won The Most Dedicated Player award within months of joining their institution's women's soccer side.A year earlier she had scooped the prestigious Player of the Year award playing for her community team Crusaders FC. She previously played for Florida Albion.While her soccer career looks to be on the up, Hartley has also been admitted to study marketing management at UJ."I wanted to be a teacher but there was no space to study education. I will still study towards a degree in education because I am passionate about teaching," she said during an interview at the UJ soccer fields this week.She said she started playing at 13 after her father introduced her to indoor soccer."I soon moved to playing outdoor soccer and just carried on from there."I am now part of UJ's first team and we participate in the Sasol Women's League and play competitive matches every weekend."She said her father bought her her first pair of boots when she was still a tiny tot."I love both Nike and Adidas but Nike is my brand of choice."Her father, who also had brief stints in Portugal and France, has watched her play several times but she does not feel the pressure to emulate him. "People have a lot of expectations even though I am a girl. I think everyone thinks I should be where he was."She said despite enjoying every moment of her career, she was struggling to take criticism positively."I am working on developing a thick skin. My family supports me a lot."Some of her future plans are to play for Sundowns and Banyana Banyana."I want to be successful and become an advocate of women's soccer."
