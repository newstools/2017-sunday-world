 A group of people, among them children, who Nonhlanhla Qwabe, popularly known as Skolopad, had just entertained with her suggestive dance moves a few minutes earlier, greeted her with confused looks this time around."Wow! Is this woman a nurse? Is it the same person who was dancing? Miracles!" shouts one woman from the crowd.Unperturbed, the lady pulls one of her dance moves to removed any lingering doubts that it is indeed Skolopad .Qwabe is also known as the lady in the yellow dress, owing to a revealing outfit she wore at last month's Metro FM Awards in Durban.
