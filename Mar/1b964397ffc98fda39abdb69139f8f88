 DJ Cleo discovered Brickz in the late 2000 s leading to a number of successful collaborations between the two. The pair later fell out after Brickz apparently called Cleo gay. Reports several months ago claimed that Brickz had approached DJ Cleo with his tail between his legs begging his former mentor to take him under his wing again.The pair were silent on the reports but Cleo took to social media on Tuesday to finally confirm that the pair had buried the hatchet and were in studio recording a new song together.He posted a video of Brickz dancing excitedly to their new song and announced that the track would be available from this Friday.
