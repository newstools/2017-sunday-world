"When people come to my performances they will see a lot of flesh"Skolopad, as she is affectionately known in music circles, tickled the funny bones of male patrons at Ballerz nightclub in Melville, Joburg, when she intermittently flashed her punani and her tattooed derriere while performing at the joint.Qwabe, who was there to spin the discs, arrived at the club clad in a black see-through bodysuit as if she was out on the pull.She then went into the bathroom and changed into a sexually provocative number.When a bevy of photographers asked her to pose for pictures, Qwabe knelt on the white couch and bent over backward as if she was about to have a doggie, giving photographers a bird's eye view of her black forest.She told Sunday World that she loves her butt hence she even drew a tattoo on it."When people come to my performances they will see a lot of flesh and I will make sure they see my tattooed butt," Qwabe said, as she twerked to drooling patrons.The controversial vixen, who hails from Qwa Qwa in the Free State, said her sexually provocative attire kept the wolf from the door for her."When we were coming this way [to Joburg], we only had petrol money and nothing for food and we were hungry."She said that at one of the garages they stopped at she went into the shop and came back with buns and juice for them to eat."A man was staring at me, I told him 'tlohela ho ntonela mahlo ompatalle mona' [stop staring at me and pay for this] and that's how we got the food."Qwabe said she did not care what people say about her as long as she was comfortable in her skin."I am an independent woman, I don't need anything from anyone," she said.
