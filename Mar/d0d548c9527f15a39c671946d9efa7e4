 The latest trend among women is eating tons of pineapple. And it seems there is plenty of truth in this statement.Food website Pork &amp; Gin asked six couples to eat pineapple and have oral sex for one week."Participants whose partners ate 200 grams of pineapple a day reported that the pineapple eaters did, in fact, taste sweeter," the website says.Pineapples have an exceptional juiciness and a refreshing tropical flavour balancing tastes of sweet and tart.It is also an excellent source of vitamin C and manganese, copper and a good source of vitamin B1 and vitamin B6. It aids in digestion and is a good source of folate and pantothenic acid or vitamin B5, which helps the body convert food into fuel.Other fruits said to make you smell like heaven are kiwi, blueberries, mango, red grapes, cranberries, guava, watermelon and strawberries.David "Avocado" Wolfe, raw foodist and promoter of alternative medicine, says every female has her own personal and slightly different scent.The smell is a combination of the normal bacteria that reside in your vagina, your diet, underwear - natural fabrics or synthetics, your level of hygiene, your bathroom habits, and what your glands secrete.So, just like atchar can make your armpits smell bad, certain foods and drinks can cause a nasty odour down south.Not the best situation when you want your man to pleasure you orally. Vaginas sweat too. It secretes pheromones that are supposed to trigger sexual interest and excitement.Wolfe explains that the smell can also be temporarily affected by menstruation, an infection, and even sex.And if it's really a strong stench of fish, worse than Kenny Kunene's sushi kind, it may be signs of an infection and an imbalance in the pH levels.pH refers to "potential of hydrogen". It tells how acidic or alkaline a substance is on a scale from 0 to 14. Gynaecologists agree that the normal vaginal PH is 3.8 to 4.5.Things that upset the pH balance are often antibiotics and unbalanced hormones caused by contraceptives.What goes in must come down - and it's not always going to be pleasant.Probiotics are often prescribed to correct this - they are found in yoghurt too - so a cup a day won't keep your man away.The Simply Organic website also confirms that nuts and seeds are good for preventing dryness of the genitals, and are high in vitamin E.Almonds and pumpkin seeds are high in zinc, which helps combat itching and regulates the menstrual cycle.It's a known fact that alcohol makes you horny.But too many tequilas and sugar-laden ciders can contribute to bad odour down under.But the good news is that vaginas are self-cleaning and they naturally produce some discharge that helps to eject germs and bacteria out of your body.Plenty of water and a shot of citro-soda should sort you out.According to Myvag.com and the Kinsey Institute, smoking also gives your vulva an ashtray odour.Other things to have in moderation are beer, coffee, asparagus and broccoli.And for the gents - whose semen often tastes like bleach - try citrus fruits, bananas and papayas. Also try spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, peppermint, parsley, wheatgrass and celery.
