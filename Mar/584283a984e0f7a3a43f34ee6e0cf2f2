 TV personality Dineo Ranaka posted a picture of herself with Bra Hugh but she had her hair covered in a blankie. Dineo explained that she had to cover her weave so that she could have a picture with the legendary musician. So all I had in my possession was a blankie and I was very happy to wrap my hair in it for a photograph with him! It s a true story ladies Bra Hugh (I prefer to call him Ntate Hugh but he insists on Bra Hugh) will not be photographed with any artificial or straightened hair! Dineo wasn t offended by the demand though and simply covered up. Most are offended by this however I ve learnt to not let the opinions or preferences of others kill my joy. Respecting each other s differences and being open to meet one another half way makes life and it s precious moments all the more pleasurable I refuse to let ego rob me of a moment to smile and be merry! We laughed a lot in this moment he s a lovely man!
