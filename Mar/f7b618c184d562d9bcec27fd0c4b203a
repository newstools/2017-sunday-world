 Born Lungisani Khuzwayo, he is the creator of Umvulo, one of the current hit songs in the house music fraternity."If you are not educated it will be hard for you to understand your contracts," he said.He said most artists have fallen out with record labels because they did not understand what they were getting themselves into in the first place when they joined those stables."The next thing they go to newspapers complaining of being robbed. It's not the label, it's you for not getting [an] education," he said.Khuzwayo, 28, also encouraged upcoming artists to attend music workshops to learn about royalties and shares they are entitled to if they have written a song or produced one."You need to have the knowledge before you get too exposed to the industry, because you will be exploited if you don't know how things work."He said his passion for music dated back to his school days in Port Shepstone, KwaZulu-Natal. "As my music career gained momentum, my school work was suffering. I had to drop out when I was doing Grade 11 because I was too busy with gigs."He said he was inspired by Sipho "Hotstix" Mabuse and went back to finish his matric at the age of 22. Mabuse wrote his matric in his 60s.
