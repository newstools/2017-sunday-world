"I've been auditioning for the past three years. I'm happy that my time has come"Known for playing fun-loving characters both on television and stage, Buthelezi, 34, is the new host of the next 13 episodes, starting from May 6, while current host Thembisa Mdoda takes a break."I'm looking forward to having lots of fun, those who know me can attest to that I enjoy bringing some vibe to any situation," said Buthelezi.She emphasises that she won't be acting as a presenter or host, but one of the VIP guests attending a wedding."I've been auditioning without success for the past three years. I'm happy that my time has come."Buthelezi said she couldn't believe it when her agent called her last month with the news that she got the nod to become the next presenter of OPW."I thought they were playing an April Fools joke on me. I love weddings and all the pomp and ceremony that go with them, I will make the most of this opportunity."You've seen at most weddings where brides are overcome with emotion and cry. Why? It's their big day, I want to see them enjoying themselves to the fullest, laughing and not shedding tears but I also understand that sometimes it's tears of joy," said Buthelezi.The bubbly entertainer has recently been making waves on the small screen as the nosy and prying MaMnisi on the taxi wars drama Isibaya and she plays the full-of-tricks Slenda on the all-women prison series Lockdown."I have a soft spot for Isibaya, the story line is dear to my heart."But I also love being on stage, doing comedy after being told at the Market Theatre that 'my money was on comedy'," she said.
