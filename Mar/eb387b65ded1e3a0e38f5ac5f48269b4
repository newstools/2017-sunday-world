 Khumalo, who has been hit by a series of health issues over the past decade, said she will be operated on for ulcers after she collapsed while working in the studio.At the time of her latest health scare, the Mina Ngiyohlala Nginje hit-maker and actress was recording a new song with DJ Cleo.Khumalo, who was introduced to the music scene by late pop icon Brenda Fassie and has worked with greats such as Chicco Twala and DJ Oscar , said she first felt exhausted while they were working."I then felt dizzy and knew that something was wrong. The next thing I was in hospital."I suspect that I fell ill because of work and fatigue," she said.The Soweto-born artist said her health woes had prevented her from reaching her true potential, but she was hopeful the medical procedure will help her."I am not supposed to be stressed. The moment I stress, my ulcers play up."I need to get this under control. It is slowing down my progress, I'm frustrated."As a result of her ill health, Khumalo playfully described herself as a part-time patient who is always in and out of hospital.DJ Cleo said: "We had recorded three songs. We were recording Yile Gqom, which is a single for her upcoming album, when she started complaining of abdominal and chest pains."I rushed her to hospital where she was admitted. The song is incomplete."I hope that she recovers soon so that we can finish recording."When Khumalo is well enough, she intends on pushing her record label, Winnie K Music Records and Management, to greater heights.
