"Dance productions are important because it is a platform to show the people our ideas, dreams and ambitions"The group, which is made up of actors from The Market Theatre Lab and dancers from Moving into Dance Mophatong, both based in Newtown, Joburg, are giving the art of stage performance a serious face lift.Dimpho More, 22, from Nelspruit in Mpumalanga, is a fierce actress who makes the stage come alive.She says the performance she is most proud of was the character she portrayed in director Sbusiso Mamba's Six Characters in Search of an Author, which was staged at the Market Theatre last year."The feedback that I got on social media was that the audience enjoyed it. I played a power-hungry woman who thinks money defines her success," she says.She also featured in James Ngcobo's production, The Children's Monologues, which premiered last year."It's all about telling stories that television is afraid of," says More.She says the theatre bug hit her while she was in high school but her mother persuaded her to study marketing."I always knew that I wanna be a performer but my mother wanted me to get a normal nine-to-five. I did a few courses but didn't graduate," she laughs.She made the decision to follow her passion in 2015 when she moved to Jozi to study acting."People stories have always fascinated me, from how people behave in taxi ranks to how tsotsis in the hood conduct their lives. I find that theatre gives me more of an opportunity to explore and bring all that interests me on stage."The bubbly actress adds that she made her directing debut last year, when she worked with primary school kids in Soweto to produce their own play, titled Dreams, which was staged at the Soweto Theatre."I found that I have a skill to guide kids towards achieving a common goal," she giggles.Katlego Letsholonyane, 25, from Klerksdorp in North West, is a comedic genius in James Mphahlele's Motemele.He chose theatre to help heal his wounds after his mother died in a car accident."Theatre became my refuge," he says.He adds that he was drawn to theatre because of its realness."You don't get to pause and continue during a performance, so for me that makes it a true emotional experience."He too didn't have the support of family when he decided to be an actor professionally."My aunt and uncles didn't understand the process when I was still trying to find myself," he says.Letsholonyane has an eclectic and entertaining persona - he tells us his first exposure to performing on stage was in a neighbourhood play called Lepotata."My first professional role was directed by James Ngcobo and it was called Ketekang."Letsholonyane says he chose theatre as opposed to television because it is the right place to start an acting career."I feel like this is the perfect platform to learn the ins and outs of the industry, whilst you master your craft."Although his first love is theatre, he says he will not refuse a television role."To be a complete actor, I have to immerse myself in every role possible, that is how you see your strengths and weakness."Asanda Ruda is a 23-year-old choreographer and dance teacher who brought magic to the Dance Umbrella Festival, which ended on March 5.Ruda, from Pimville in Soweto, prepared for the festival in the dance studios a few metres from The Market Theatre Lab.This is her second year as part of the production team."My works seek to send a message to the audience, whether to share an opinion with them or to simply teach them something," she says.She has been dancing since high school but only recently became a professional choreographer."Dance productions are important because it is a platform to show the people our ideas, dreams and ambitions."She says although dance productions are part of the theatre experience, they are not limited to a building or a stage."We can literally dance anywhere, whether it be in a shopping mall or in a theatre, the side of the road... that is what I like most about dance," she says.She adds that unlike acting or music, dancing speaks a language of the body, which is often understood by everyone.Award-winning dancers and choreographers Sunnyboy Motau, 30, and Oscar Buthulezi, 25, premiered two dance works at the recent Dance Umbrella Festival.I am NoT... was presented by Motau and Stuck Souls by Buthelezi.They are considered among SA's best dance talent.Motau, from Alexandra in Joburg, says his moves are inspired by the ever changing patterns of human behaviour."For me the art of dance interprets the conditions of society and our environment. So things like fashion trends, love and people's struggles encourage me to come up with new ideas," he says.The fearless dancer, who has been on the choreography scene for 16 years, says his experiences as a child growing up in Alex and seeing tsotsis do the pantsula jive shaped his career."My first attempt at dancing was at Plumule Theatre Group in Alexandra, where I learnt the basics of traditional dance," he says.The soft-spoken mover and shaker says his mother hoped he would be a doctor or lawyerSince joining the famous dance company, Moving into Dance Mophatong in 2008, he says he has been on a journey of self-discovery."The company has helped me grow into the international space. There are a lot of choreographers that also inspire me but mostly it has been a test of my character. As a kid growing up in the township, I never imagined that I would travel the world dancing, so it is a dream come true."His major international break was in 2012 when he was part of B'eauty Remained For Just A Minute then Returned Gently To Her Starting Position, which was produced by Robyn Orlin.He also performed at the Fifa World Cup 2010 kickoff concert and at dance festivals in Germany, France and Italy.Buthelezi began dancing in 1998, as member of the Vosloorus Mapantsula Youth Club were he grew up.He is among the youngest trainees of Moving into Dance, who are fast becoming world recognised choreographers."To be honest with you, man, I didn't take this thing seriously when I was a kid."But the burly choreographer says he has his mother to thank for his success in the industry."She is the one who believed I can take this thing to the next level, and I will always be grateful for it ."He was accepted as a student at Moving into Dance in 2010, a move that opened many doors for him."It has been quite a journey. I have learnt how to tell stories using body movements."Now a member of the professional dance academy, he has been performing at the Dance Umbrella from the time he was still a student."The Dance Umbrella showed me that anything is possible; you can tell a story through dance that a song or good book would tell," he says.He uses the medium to express himself.His future plans include touring more African countries and starting his own dance academy."I wanna show the African child that anything is possible, you just have to work hard at your dreams. There are some myths I would like to break down, including the one that says men that dance professionally are gay," he says.His goal is also to create provocative dance productions."I want to pose questions about things that people are afraid to talk about, like race, sexuality and politics."
