"She [Winnie Mashaba] is not a member of ZCC of Bishop Lekganyane, she is a member of the ZCC with a dove insignia.The artist grouping is accusing Moloi of excluding ZCC-affiliated artists in favour of those from charismatic churches for the Mapungubwe Easter Gospel show.LAM had called all the artists and the citizens of Limpopo to boycott the show, scheduled for Polokwane showground on April 15, in solidarity with the sidelined ZCC artists.The organisation also alleged that Moloi, who is fondly known as MEC Wodumo in the province, ignored pleas from her officials to visit ZCC headquarters in Moria and solicit their input about the inclusion of ZCC-aligned artists in the show.LAM chairman Mpho Mashabela confirmed they were at loggerheads with Moloi over her decision to exclude the ZCC artists."How do you have a gospel festival in Limpopo during the Easter holidays where all Africans are converging for the ZCC pilgrimage in Moria and not include ZCC artists?"This is the biggest church in Africa and the exclusion of the ZCC artists is, by all means, not only an insult to us as an organisation but also a sheer disregard and disrespect for this church."This is not an inclusive festival, it is dominated by bazalwane [artists aligned to charismatic churches] to the exclusion of masione [ZCC] ," he said.Mashabela said Moloi thought she would fool them into keeping quiet by including Winnie Mashaba in the line-up."She is not a member of the ZCC of Bishop Lekganyane, the one with a star insignia, which is the biggest one. She is a member of the ZCC with a dove insignia."The MEC is undermining the church and dividing Christians, and we can't fold our arms and allow her to continue with this. We say to those who agree with us, stay at home, don't go to the festival," he said.Among the prominent ZCC artists excluded from the show were Solly Moholo, Matlakala and Conny Lamola.According to the posters distributed in the province, Sechaba Pali, Dr Tumi, Lebo Sekgobela, Solly Mahlangu, Hlengiwe Mhlaba and Deborah Fraser are among those contracted to perform at the show.Moloi's spokesman Moloko Moloto said none of the artists who will participate at the festival were chosen on the basis of their church affiliation.He said Moloi's department organised the festival after service provider Joe Chakela pulled out this week."Mr Mphoza Mashabela, who represented the Limpopo Artists Movement as chairperson, recommended the names of musicians, and seven of them were included in the line-up."MEC Moloi has immense respect for all the churches," he said.
