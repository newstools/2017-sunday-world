 Pearl s name popped up on the full list of war room members when whistleblower and PR expert Sihle Bolani filed a second lawsuit against the ANC last week.Sihle first filed a R2.3-million lawsuit against the ruling party in January claiming that the party owed her for services rendered .However the matter was struck off the court roll but Sihle has filed another lawsuit for a whopping R4-million isn t paid the R1 million promised to her as compromise.In the second application, the socialite also implicated Mzansi's high-flying girl and sports presenter Robert Marawa's girlfriend Pearl Thusi.She claimed that Thusi, who stars in American series Quantico, participated in 12 episodes of a campaign called 'Right to vote'.TshisaLIVE recently sat down with the actress and had to ask about the fiasco.Pearl seemed dumbstruck by the allegations and claimed she knew nothing about the debacle. Why do you wanna tell me about a knife that someone is trying to stick in my back that I didn t even know about? I don t know anything about what you are saying or what you were about to say she said.
