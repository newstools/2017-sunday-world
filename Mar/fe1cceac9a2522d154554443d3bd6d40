So I got to speak to you, tell you what's going on."Yeah, I guarantee you, I will guarantee you, I will guarantee you 150200%. You [will] probably never hear my f***ing ass on the radio again. That's what I guarantee you right now - 200%," he said.The artist then asked for support from his fans and said he did what he did for them.He begged them not to be sell-outs and encouraged them to emulate him.Riky Rick then told his followers that he was asked to tweet his apology after the incident but he fobbed them off."That's why I need you guys, I need you, I need you now more than ever. They trying to get me to apologise to the radio. They try to get me to send out tweets and all that s**t. I said f**k that s**t bra. Ain't apologise for nothing, f**k that," he said without revealing who asked him to apologise.He said he would not sacrifice his morals just so his music could be played on radio for the sake of fame. The musician also called on his fans who would like to be musicians to be independent and not to sign recording deals with any stable.He claimed he would be targeted for what he stood for and was ready to deal with the consequences of his actions."They gonna come for me, you gonna see a lot about me in the tabloid."SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said they have received the video but they did not know what Riky Rick was talking about."We don't know what he is talking about because we have not taken a decision not to play his music," he said.
