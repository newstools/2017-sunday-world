 Mafela died in a car accident on Saturday night aged 75.The news was shared by actor Mangaliso Ngema on his Facebook page yesterday following a meeting between the family and the church."We visited the Joe Mafela home last night to pay our respects. I was shocked to learn that Grace Bible Church, in Soweto, wanted a fee of R89000 for the memorial," he said. "When the head pastor [Musa] Sono was consulted, he offered a R10k discount. Needless to say, there was no deal as this is totally ridiculous. This is supposed to be 'a house of God' serving the community."
