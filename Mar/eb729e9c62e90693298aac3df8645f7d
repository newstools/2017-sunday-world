 In an interview with Drum magazine Ayanda confirmed that she and her mother-in-law haven t had the best relationship.Ayanda said that their relationship was strained and claimed that Fikile had apparently not checked on her since the gospel star s death. Not really. She has not checked on us. Sfiso was all about healing through song. I thought the funeral would unite us she said.Ayanda also set the record straight on swirling reports that she had kept information about Sfiso s death away from his mother.She rubbished the claim explaining that in the moments after Sfiso s death she immediately sent a car to fetch Fikile so that they could do everything together . If family members want to know something they know what to do. I will not disrespect my husband and publish his post-mortem report she said.Earlier this month Ayanda told Ukhozi FM that she did not want to disrespect Sfiso s memory by discussing their family issues in public. I am hurt by some of the stories that have come up after my husband passed. Sfiso respected himself a lot. As his wife I will never disrespect his memory by failing his family or our children with my behaviour. Because that is what he has taught me she said at the time.
