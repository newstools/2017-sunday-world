 Shange s emotional speech at the memorial on Thursday resonated with many and saw her trend on social media over her comments about the industry not valuing its talent.Speaking to TshisaLIVE after her address Shange said that she was tired of the oppression of the industry and decided to take a stand. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I don t speak much in public. All these years I have been silent and never complained but I was sitting there thinking about Joe and I realised that I just had to speak for Joe because he could not speak for himself. I needed to let people know that we (actors) are living a hard life and are struggling Cynthia said.She said that she was disgusted that a man who had given so much service to the nation and the industry should die in a Ford Figo. If he was in any other industry his hard work would have been rewarded accordingly and he would have died in a 4x4 or something much better than a Ford Figo. We pretend that everything is okay and smile but it is not okay Shange said.She said that conditions were so bad in the industry that she often envied cashiers and factory workers. I envy them. Maybe they have a medical aid. They are permanent. They have stability. People celebrate me in the streets because they think I have money or that I am rich but if my daughter had not bought me a car I would still be riding in a taxi. People say that we (actors) inspire them and encourage them to make their lives but who makes our lives better? she added.Shange said that she was speaking out in hope that it would be better for the generations who would later join the industry. I may not be around in a year s time but I have to say something so that things change and that those who come after us do not get exploited like we are Shange said.
