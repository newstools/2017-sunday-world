 Baxter who did not want to elaborate on when his current contract with United is due to come to an end was an outsider for the vacant Bafana Bafana job together with big hitters Carlos Queiroz Herve Renard and Hugo Broos.Queiroz looks to be out of the running for the Bafana job because he is tied up by high-figure release clauses on their contracts with respective employers in Iran and Morocco.Renard s representatives claim the Africa Cup of Nations winner with Zambia in 2012 and Ivory Coast in 2015 has not been contacted by Safa.Broos who is reported to be looking for a new challenge after leading unfancied Cameroon to Nations Cup success in January appears to be the favourite to replace fired Shakes Mashaba.Mashaba is currently battling his dismissal at Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).Baxter who coached Bafana in 2004 and 2005 said he is close to extending his stay at SuperSport. At the moment I am closer to signing an extension with SuperSport United rather than discussing speculation until its concrete. If it s concrete I will tell anyone but at the moment I have not spoken to Safa he said.Baxter said his focus is firmly on United adding he was thoroughly enjoying himself at the club as they are currently involved in three competitions the Nedbank Cup Caf Confederation Cup and the Absa Premiership. I am here and I am doing my job unless you guys come and tell me something different he said. I have known of interest from Safa for a long time I just tried to deflect it because it was speculation and very loose. I have never applied for a job in my life and if there is any interest it is based on what I have been doing at club level and my experience. At the moment I am answering speculation and I don t like to do that.
