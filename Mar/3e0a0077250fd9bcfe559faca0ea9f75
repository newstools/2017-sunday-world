He (the other driver) lied to the police about the accident and said I was drunkMolefe faced two charges of culpable homicide and drunken driving after the head-on collision crash which happened near Hartbeespoort in North West in December.However, Molefe says charges against him were withdrawn last month.Pontsho Moloi, 33, and Mahlomola Tsotetsi, 32, a couple from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, was killed in the accident.The two were driving a white Ford Bantam bakkie when it allegedly collided with Molefe's Mercedez Benz C63.Police spokesman Sabata Mokgwabone confirmed that Molefe was arrested and later released on a warning."Yes, we can confirm that a case was opened at Hartbeespoort police station. He is facing charges of culpable homicide and drunken driving. Investigation is under way and blood results are still awaited from the laboratory."Mokgwabone said Molefe was admitted to Kalafong Hospital in Atteridgeville, west of Pretoria, due to injuries he sustained during the incident."After consultation with the control prosecutor and appearance in absentia, Mr Molefe was warned to appear in court on 20 February 2017."Mokgwabone said the accident involved three cars, but said the driver of the third car was never arrested or charged."There's only one person who is facing charges from the accident," he added.However, Molefe said he blamed the police, whom he accused of negligence and wrongfully charging him for the death of the couple. He said police ignored his statement about the involvement of a red VW Polo driver who had tried to overtake him."But now the story is being told as if I'm the one who hit the bakkie. And that's not how the accident happened," he said.Recalling how the accident happened, Molefe said the head-on collision happened near the Nuclear Energy Corporation of SA plant when he had just turned the corner.He described it as a high- speed collision, saying the red Polo was driving on the wrong side of the road, trying to overtake him.Molefe, who according to the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission records owns South Collection Property Investments and Sopeng Marketing, said while overtaking him , the red Polo hit his car and then proceeded to hit the bakkie head-on."He lied to the police about the accident and said I was drunk. I was unconscious at the time. When I woke up, the police told me that they took my blood for tests," he said.Molefe confirmed that he appeared in court on February 20, but said the charges against him have been withdrawn."The prosecutor could not even find my statement, photos of the accident and there were no postmortems [records]. She decided not to prosecute."He insisted that he was not drunk when the accident happened.Asked if he had apologised to the families of the deceased, Molefe said he was advised by the investigating officer and his lawyers not to contact them.The families of the two people who were killed in an accident that involved Brian Molefe's younger brother Neville are fuming over the news that the man is walking free.Speaking from their homes in Katlehong on the East Rand, Ruth Kganyago, Pontsho Moloi's mother, and Ntsietseng Tsotetsi, Mahlomola Tsotetsi's sister, flayed police over the investigation of the accident.Kganyago said she had been waiting for the police to give her a court date so she could attend, but she had not heard anything from them."I have always sensed that something wrong was happening because those people told us they were going to give us a court date and then they went silent for three months."We don't know what's happening with the case."The policeman cannot cancel the case until he (Molefe) tells us why he killed our kids. He must explain to us what happened on that night and why the police found beers in his car," she said.Kganyago said her daughter's death has left the family broken as she left behind three young kids that need to be taken care of. "As I'm speaking to you, I could not stay with them because I can't walk," she said, sobbing. The kids are aged four, seven and 13 years.Tsotetsi's family also said they had not been informed about the court date, let alone the court's decision to withdraw the charges."Tell me if you don't see corruption when a drunk man kills two people in an accident and the next thing he is not charged or sent to prison," said Ntsietseng.She said the last time she spoke to the police, they told them Molefe was still in hospital and that they would be given a date and time when he would be appearing in court."We hoped that seeing him appearing in court would help us get closure. But we are still waiting because they have not said anything to us," she said.Ntsietseng was shocked when Sunday World told her that Molefe was out on free bail and that the charges have been withdrawn.She said during the funeral arrangements in December, her brother Jacob received a call from a woman who said she was Molefe's sister offering to help with the funeral.She said Jacob dismissed her as they suspected she might have wanted to bribe them.Jacob confirmed he received the call but said he was advised by Tsotetsi's employer not to meet with the woman.Tsotetsi has left behind one child.
