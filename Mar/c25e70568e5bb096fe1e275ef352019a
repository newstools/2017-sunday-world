 The flautist is unique in that he combines the flute with electro beats. His latest single, My Name in the Echo, is his first attempt at combining jazz with other electro beats.It has even caught on overseas as it debuted in the US."It was aired on various radio stations in Los Angeles. The song speaks about human experiences and love," he says.His mother often told him how he inherited his amazing gift from his grandfather."She would tell me how he led the neighbourhood orchestra with the flute. I was told he was a master and I wanted to follow in his footsteps," he says.He learnt to play the instrument in 1999, when he joined a community music initiative called Tsalapeng."I was among a few youngsters who wanted to learn the flute, it was not a popular instrument like the cornet or trumpet," he says.In 2002 he received a bursary to study music professionally with the Helen Vosloo Music Academy in Melville, a suburb in Joburg."I learned a lot during my time there. Helen is one of the greatest flautist on the African continent," he says.During his time at the academy, Siwela says he learnt how to compose and arrange his own music."After completing my lessons, I decided to start my own flute institute in the area I came from."I realised that a lot of young people from Hammanskraal do not have a place to develop their musical talents," he says.His initiative is called the C'nky Siwela Flute Institute, which he started three years ago."So far I have taken two of my best students to Belgium to attend flute master classes," he says. He adds that in April he intends to take four students for a life changing experience overseas.Besides his community project, the 33-year-old says he released his first single in 2012 as a solo artist, after more than 10 years working with orchestras."The single was called Reminisce of the Sounds. That was me trying to find the sound I wanted."
