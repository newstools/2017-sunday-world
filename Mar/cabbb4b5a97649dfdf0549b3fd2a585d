 Biblos, as he is affectionately known, said broadcasters sideline a lot of deserving artists like him and play the same music over and over."Riky Rick is our hero, when he spoke at the [Metro FM] awards I felt that he was talking about us. He encouraged us a lot," he said.Ledwaba, 34, said he felt that Mr Kotini was speaking for those whose music is big on the streets but never gets played on radio."Why should they play my music when I am dead, just to raise their sales? Here they wait for you to die before they play your music which means our death is their success."Some of his songs include the controversial Sbono Ses'tout which he admitted cannot be played on radio because of its explicit content."When we do proper music with nice lyrics they still don't play it. So we are the kings of the streets music, we know what sells in the streets and we get booked a lot," he said.He said instead of waiting for his music to be played, he went across the border 10 years ago to create a following elsewhere."I went to Namibia and created the market . They play it [my music] on their radio stations and even nominated me for awards that side."Ledwaba has been in the industry for the past 18 years. He released his first song Puntsununu at the age of 16."I had to push trolleys in town to make money to record the song," he remembers.
