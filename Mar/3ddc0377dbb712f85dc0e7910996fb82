 In a string of tweets Ntando shared how a family member had an abortion for a third time and was apparently proud of it.The TV personality s comments sparked a fierce debate among Ntando s fans which prompted her to issue an apology. I would like to apologise to anybody that I may have offended through my earlier tweets regarding a family member whom has undergone a series of abortions she said.Ntando explained that she spoke out from a place of concern over the high abortion rate. I was speaking from a concerned and emotional place without thinking of the consequences of my words and how offensive hurtful and insensitive they might be to not just my family member but anybody else that has gone through what she has whether by choice or not she added.Ntando said she intended to create awareness around young people having unprotected sex without thinking about the consequences.The actress now plans to start a project to help educate the youth. I feel very strongly about this subject and still feel that it needs to be addressed urgently and because of the seriousness of this matter I have decided that I will establish a project or awareness campaign she added.
