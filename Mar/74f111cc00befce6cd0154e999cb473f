 Jonevret boasted that he does not have any draws yet in the derby, in reference to some of the dull stalemates we've seen in this encounter recently.So he'll be out to liven up this encounter and make sure it's "a Saturday to remember" for supporters.Looking at how he addresses the media and interacts with supporters of the club, Jonevret has clearly settled to life in South Africa and is unlikely to be overwhelmed by the big occasion at FNB Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm).Tenth-placed Pirates would argue that they need the win more than their rivals to end a 10 match win-less run."We want to win the game. It should be a Saturday we remember for a long time. It's my first derby, so I don't have any draws yet. It's a chance to make it something positive maybe. It's important that I do my [own] thing," said Jonevret."Since I arrived last Sunday, it has been hectic. I have been meeting new players and trying to learn the names of players and do positive things on the training ground."When you meet people [in the streets], they say 'Saturday', but it's mostly been positive."I am looking forward to it. It should be fantastic. I have played a lot of derbies before, so those games are special."Pirates captain Oupa Manyisa, who has come under-fire for below par performances, wants to repay the faith Jonevret has shown in him by retaining him as a skipper."He believes in me and wants me to be the captain of the team. He came and said he wants me to be captain. I want to help him to unite the guys," said Manyisa.
