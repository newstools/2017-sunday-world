My mom and dad are my inspiration and considering that they have been in the industry for so long alongside my grandparents...I will also excel in my own right. I am not going to live under their shadow but I am going to make sure that I also build a name for myself Bahumi said.According to Drum Bahumi impressed the makers of Keeping Score enough for them to give her the role of Zola on the show.
