 The problem started when Sehloho allegedly accused Marhanele of stealing his job and sticking his nose into the artist's management affairs.Marhanele's peccadillo was to confirm to a weekly magazine that the Ndikhokhele hitmaker was in the studio cooking songs with award-winning gospel duo Jaziel Brothers.Upon reading the article, Sehloho phoned his associates and said Marhanele pulled the wool over the public's eye when he confirmed the collaboration of the artists.He said even if it were true, Marhanele had no business confirming the collaboration in the media as he no longer had the authority to speak on the matter.
